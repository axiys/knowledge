      **Structuring**, also known as **smurfing**, is a method used in money laundering during the
      placement stage. It involves breaking large sums of money into smaller amounts to avoid
      triggering Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs). In the U.S., financial institutions must file
      a CTR for cash transactions over $10,000. Criminals may spread deposits across multiple days,
      branches, or accounts to avoid detection. Structuring is illegal under AML laws and is one of
      the most common techniques flagged by transaction monitoring systems.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is structuring in the context of money laundering?
        answer: |
          Structuring is the act of breaking down large transactions into smaller ones to avoid
          triggering regulatory reporting thresholds, such as the $10,000 CTR requirement.
      - question: |
          At what dollar threshold must a U.S. financial institution file a Currency Transaction Report?
        answer: |
          $10,000.
      - question: |
          Why do criminals use structuring?
        answer: |
          Criminals use structuring to avoid regulatory detection and reporting of large cash deposits.

  - context: |
      **Private banking** clients are considered higher risk for money laundering due to high net
      worth, international exposure, and the use of intermediaries or offshore structures. These
      accounts often involve confidentiality, complex ownership, and large transactions. Enhanced
      due diligence (EDD) is usually required. Red flags include reluctance to provide source of
      wealth, third-party involvement in account opening, and frequent wire transfers to high-risk
      jurisdictions.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why are private banking clients considered high risk for money laundering?
        answer: |
          Due to high transaction volumes, complex structures, international ties, and use of intermediaries.
      - question: |
          What AML control is essential for private banking clients?
        answer: |
          Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).
      - question: |
          Name one red flag in private banking relationships.
        answer: |
          Use of third-party intermediaries to open accounts or reluctance to disclose source of wealth.

  - context: |
      **Sanctions compliance** involves screening individuals, entities, and transactions against
      government-issued sanctions lists like the U.S. Treasury's **OFAC SDN list**. If a match is
      confirmed, U.S. persons must block the assets and report to OFAC within 10 business days.
      Blocking includes placing funds in an interest-bearing account and prohibiting further
      movement. Failure to comply may result in civil and criminal penalties.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What does OFAC require if a U.S. person receives a payment from a sanctioned entity?
        answer: |
          The funds must be blocked and placed in an interest-bearing account, and OFAC must be notified.
      - question: |
          What is the OFAC list that financial institutions must screen against?
        answer: |
          The Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.
      - question: |
          How soon must a blocked transaction be reported to OFAC?
        answer: |
          Within 10 business days.

  - context: |
      **Fraud** involves deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain. In financial services,
      common types of fraud include identity theft, credit card fraud, and insurance fraud. Red flags
      include inconsistent customer details, high-volume transactions after dormancy, or rapid movement
      of funds to new beneficiaries. Fraud risk assessments help institutions identify and mitigate
      vulnerabilities.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is financial fraud?
        answer: |
          Financial fraud is intentional deception for financial gain, such as identity theft or misuse of funds.
      - question: |
          Give one red flag for potential fraud in an account.
        answer: |
          Unusual high-value transactions after a period of inactivity.
      - question: |
          What tool do institutions use to assess fraud vulnerabilities?
        answer: |
          A fraud risk assessment.

  - context: |
      **Correspondent banking** allows one financial institution to provide services to another,
      usually across borders. These relationships can introduce AML risks if the correspondent bank
      does not fully understand the respondent bank’s customer base or controls. High-risk indicators
      include shell banks, nested accounts, and lack of transparency. Regulatory expectations include
      conducting due diligence and, where appropriate, **enhanced due diligence (EDD)** on the
      respondent.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is correspondent banking?
        answer: |
          It's a relationship where one financial institution provides banking services to another,
          often cross-border.
      - question: |
          What is a key AML risk in correspondent banking?
        answer: |
          Lack of visibility into the respondent bank’s customers and nested accounts.
      - question: |
          What kind of due diligence is required for high-risk correspondent banking relationships?
        answer: |
          Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).
