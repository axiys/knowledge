Risks and Methods of

Money Laundering and

Terrorist Financing

Overview

What Is Money Laundering?

Money laundering involves taking criminal proceeds and disguising their illegal

sources in order to use the funds to perform legal or illegal activities. Simply
put, money laundering is the process of making dirty money look clean.

When a criminal activity generates substantial profits, the individual or group

involved must find a way to use the funds without drawing attention to the

underlying activity or persons involved in generating such profits. Criminals

achieve this goal by disguising the source of funds, changing the form of the

currency, or moving the money to a place where it is less likely to attract

attention. Criminal activities that lead to money laundering (i.e., predicate

crimes) can include illegal arms sales, narcotics trafficking, contraband

smuggling, and other activities related to organized crime, embezzlement,

insider trading, bribery, and computer fraud schemes.

Formed in 1989, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an

intergovernmental body created by the Group of Seven industrialized nations

to set standards and foster international action against money laundering.

One of FATF’s early accomplishments was to dispel the notion that money

laundering only involves cash transactions. Through several money laundering
typologies exercises, FATF demonstrated that money laundering can be

achieved through virtually every medium, financial organization, and business.

Version 6.44

The United Nations 2000 Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,

also known as the Palermo Convention, defines money laundering as:

•  The conversion or transfer of property, knowing it is derived from a

criminal offense, for the purpose of concealing or disguising its illicit origin
or of assisting any person who is involved in the commission of the crime to

evade the legal consequences of his or her actions

•  The concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location,

disposition, movement, or rights with respect to or ownership of property,

knowing that it is derived from a criminal offense

•  The acquisition, possession, or use of property, knowing at the time of its

receipt that it was derived from a criminal offense or from participation in a

crime

An important prerequisite in the definition of money laundering is knowledge.

In all three of the definitions above is the phrase "knowing that it is derived

from a criminal offense,” and a broad interpretation of knowing is generally

applied. In fact, FATF’s 40 Recommendations on Money Laundering and

Terrorist Financing and the Sixth European Union Directive on the Prevention

of the Use of the Financial System for the Purpose of Money Laundering and

Terrorist Financing state that “The intent and knowledge required to prove the

offense of money laundering includes the concept that such a mental state
may be inferred from objective factual circumstances.”

Several jurisdictions also use the legal principle of willful blindness in money

laundering cases to prove knowledge. Courts define willful blindness as the

“deliberate avoidance of knowledge of the facts” or “purposeful indifference”

and have held that willful blindness is the equivalent of actual knowledge of

the illegal source of funds or of the intentions of a customer in a money
laundering transaction.

After the events on September 11, 2001, in October 2001, FATF expanded its

mandate to address countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). Both

terrorists and money launderers can use the same methods to move their

money in ways to avoid detection, such as structuring payments to avoid

reporting and use of underground banking or value transfer systems (e.g.,

hawala, hundi, and fei ch’ien). However, while funds destined for money

laundering are derived from criminal activities, such as drug trafficking and
fraud, terrorist financing can include funds from perfectly legitimate sources.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

Concealment of funds used for terrorism is primarily designed to hide the

purpose for which these funds are used, rather than their source. Terrorist
funds might be used for operating expenses, including paying for food,

transportation, and rent, as well as for the actual material support of terrorist
acts. Terrorists, similar to criminal enterprises, value the secrecy of

transactions regarding their destination and purpose.

In February 2012 (and amended periodically since), FATF published a revised
list of its 40 recommendations, which includes a new recommendation

addressing ways to prevent, suppress, and disrupt the proliferation of

weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

Three Stages of the Money Laundering
Cycle

Money laundering often involves a complex series of transactions that are

difficult to separate. However, it is common to think of money laundering as

occurring in three stages.

Stage One: Placement—The physical disposal of cash or other assets derived
from criminal activity.

During this phase, the money launderer introduces the illicit proceeds into the

financial system. Often, this is accomplished by placing the funds into

circulation through formal financial institutions, casinos, and other legitimate

businesses, both domestic and international.

Examples of placement transactions include the following:

•  Blending of funds: Commingling illegitimate funds with legitimate funds,
such as placing the cash from illegal narcotics sales into a cash-intensive

locally owned restaurant

•  Purchasing significant stored value cards with currency

•  Foreign exchange: Purchasing foreign exchange with illegal funds

•  Breaking up amounts: Dividing cash into small amounts and depositing it

into numerous bank accounts in an attempt to evade reporting

requirements

Version 6.44

•  Currency smuggling: Cross-border, physical movement of cash or

monetary instruments

•  Loans: Repayment of legitimate loans using laundered cash

Stage Two: Layering—The separation of illicit proceeds from their source by
layers of financial transactions intended to conceal the origin of the proceeds.

The second stage involves converting the proceeds of the crime into another

form and creating complex layers of financial transactions to obscure the
source and ownership of funds.

Examples of layering transactions include:

•  Electronically moving funds from one country to another and dividing them

into advanced financial options and/or markets

•  Moving funds from one financial institution to another or within accounts at

the same institution

•  Converting the cash placed into monetary instruments

•  Reselling high-value goods and prepaid access or stored value products

•

Investing in real estate and other legitimate businesses

•  Placing money in stocks, bonds, or life insurance products

•  Using shell companies to obscure the ultimate beneficial owner and assets

Stage Three: Integration—Supplying apparent legitimacy to illicit wealth
through the reentry of the funds into the economy in what appears to be
normal business or personal transactions.

The third stage entails using laundered proceeds in seemingly normal

transactions to create the perception of legitimacy. The launderer, for

example, might choose to invest the funds in real estate, financial ventures, or

luxury assets. By the integration stage, it is exceedingly difficult to distinguish

between legal and illegal funds. This stage gives a launderer the opportunity to

increase his wealth with the proceeds of crime. Integration is generally

difficult to identify unless there are great disparities between a person’s or

company’s legitimate employment, business, or investment ventures and a

person’s wealth or a company’s income or assets.

Version 6.44

Examples of integration transactions include:

•  Purchasing luxury assets, such as property, artwork, jewelry, and high-end

automobiles

•  Entering into financial arrangements and other ventures in which

investments can be made in business enterprises

The Economic and Social Consequences of
Money Laundering

Money laundering is a result of any crime that generates profits for the

criminals involved. It knows no boundaries, and jurisdictions in which there are

weak, ineffective, or inadequate anti-money laundering (AML) and CFT

legislation and regulations are most vulnerable. However, large, well-

developed financial centers are also vulnerable to laundering due to the large

volumes of transactions that allow the launderer to blend in, as well as the

wide range of services that enable the launderer to conduct transactions in a

way that is convenient. Because most launderers want to eventually use the

proceeds of their crimes, their ultimate intent is to move funds through stable

financial systems.

Money laundering has significant negative economic and social

consequences, especially for developing countries and emerging markets.

The easy passage of funds from one organization to another, or relatively

facile systems that allow money to be placed without raising any questions, is

fertile territory for money launderers. The upholding of legal, professional, and

ethical standards is critical to the integrity of financial markets.

The potential macroeconomic consequences of unchecked money

laundering include:

•

Increased exposure to organized crime and corruption

•  Undermining the legitimate private sector

•  Weakening financial organizations

•  Dampening effect on foreign investments

•  Loss of control of, or mistakes in, decisions regarding economic policy

•  Economic distortion and instability

•  Loss of tax revenue

•  Risks to privatization efforts

•  Reputation risk for the country

•  Risk of international sanctions

•  Social costs

•  Reputational risk

•  Operational risk

•  Legal risk

•  Concentration risk

Increased Exposure to Organized Crime and Corruption

Successful money laundering enhances the profitable aspects of criminal

activity. When a country is seen as a haven for money laundering, it can attract

people who commit crimes.

Typically, havens for money laundering and terrorist financing have:

•  Limited numbers of predicate crimes for money laundering (i.e., criminal
offenses that would permit a jurisdiction to bring a money laundering

charge)

•  Limited types of organizations and persons covered by money laundering

laws and regulations

•  Little to no enforcement of the laws and weak penalties or provisions that

make it difficult to confiscate and freeze assets related to money

laundering

•  Limited regulatory capacity to effectively monitor and supervise

compliance with money laundering and terrorist financing laws and

regulations

If money laundering is prevalent, there is more likely to be corruption.

Typically, the penetration of organized crime groups in a jurisdiction is directly

linked to public and private sector corruption. Criminals might try to bribe

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 8

Version 6.44

government officials, lawyers, and employees of financial and nonfinancial

organizations so they can continue to run their criminal businesses.

In countries with weaker laws and enforcement, it is often corruption that

triggers money laundering. It also leads to increases in the use of bribery in
financial organizations, among lawyers and accountants, in the legislature, in

enforcement agencies, with police and supervisory authorities, and even with

courts and prosecutors.

A comprehensive AML/CFT framework, on the other hand, helps curb criminal

activities, eliminates profits from such activities, and discourages criminals

from operating in a country, especially where law is fully enforced and the
proceeds from crime are confiscated.

Undermining the Legitimate Private Sector

One of the most serious microeconomic effects of money laundering is felt in

the private sector.

Money launderers are known to use front companies, that is, businesses that

appear legitimate and engage in legitimate business, but are in fact controlled

by criminals who commingle the proceeds of illicit activity with legitimate

funds to hide the unlawful gains. These front companies have a competitive

advantage over legitimate firms because they have access to substantial illicit

funds, allowing them to subsidize products and services sold at below-market

rates. This makes it difficult for legitimate businesses to compete against front

companies. Clearly, the management principles of these criminal enterprises

are not consistent with traditional free market principles, which results in

further negative macroeconomic effects.

By using front companies, particularly multiple front companies, and other

investments in legitimate companies, money laundering proceeds can be

used to control whole industries and sectors of the economy of certain

countries. This increases the potential for monetary and economic instability

due to the misallocation of resources from artificial distortions in asset and

commodity prices. It also provides a vehicle for evading taxes, thus depriving
the country of revenue.

Version 6.44

Weakening Financial Organizations

Money laundering and terrorist financing can harm the soundness of a

country’s financial sector. They can negatively affect the stability of individual

banks and other financial organizations, such as securities firms and insurance
companies. Criminal activity has been associated with several bank failures

around the globe, including the closures of the first Internet bank, European
Union Bank, and Riggs Bank. The establishment and maintenance of an

effective AML/CFT program is usually part of a financial organization’s charter

to operate; noncompliance can result not only in significant civil money
penalties but also in the loss of its charter.

Dampening Effect on Foreign Investments

Although developing economies cannot afford to be overly selective about

the sources of capital they attract, there is a dampening effect on foreign

direct investment when a country’s commercial and financial sectors are

perceived to be compromised and subject to the influence of organized

crime. To maintain a business-friendly environment, these impedances need

to be eliminated.

Loss of Control of, or Mistakes in, Decisions Regarding

Economic Policy

Due to the significant amounts of money involved in the money laundering

process, in some emerging market countries, these illicit proceeds might

dwarf government budgets. This can result in the loss of control of economic

policy by governments or in policy mistakes due to measurement errors in

macroeconomic statistics.

Money laundering can adversely affect currencies and interest rates, as

launderers reinvest funds where their schemes are less likely to be detected,

rather than where rates of return are higher. Volatility in exchange and interest

rates due to unanticipated cross-border transfers of funds can also occur. To

the extent that money demand appears to shift from one country to another

because of money laundering—resulting in misleading monetary data—it can

have adverse consequences for interest and exchange rate volatility. This is
particularly true in economies based on the US dollar, as the tracking of

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 10

Version 6.44

monetary aggregates becomes more uncertain. Last, money laundering can

increase the threat of monetary instability due to the misallocation of
resources from artificial distortions in asset and commodity prices.

Economic Distortion and Instability

Money launderers are not primarily interested in profit generation from their

investments, but rather in protecting their proceeds and hiding the illegal
origin of the funds. Thus, they invest their money in activities that are not

necessarily economically beneficial to the country where the funds are

located. Furthermore, when money laundering and financial crime redirect
funds from sound investments to low-quality investments that hide their

origin, economic growth can suffer.

Loss of Tax Revenue

Of the many underlying forms of illegal activity, tax evasion is perhaps the one

with the most obvious macroeconomic impact. Money laundering diminishes

government tax revenue and therefore indirectly harms honest taxpayers. It

also makes government tax collection more difficult. This loss of revenue

generally means higher tax rates than would normally be the case.

A government revenue deficit is at the center of economic difficulties in many

countries, and correcting it is the primary focus of most economic

stabilization programs. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been

involved in efforts to improve the tax collection capabilities of its member

countries, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

(OECD) has been instrumental in moving many jurisdictions toward tax

transparency.

Risks to Privatization Efforts

Money laundering threatens the efforts of many states trying to introduce

reforms into their economies through the privatization of state-owned

properties, such as land, resources, and enterprises. Sometimes linked with

corruption or inside deals, a government might award a state privatization
tender to a criminal organization potentially at an economic loss to the public.

Moreover, while privatization initiatives are often economically beneficial, they

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 11

Version 6.44

can also serve as a vehicle to launder funds. In the past, criminals have been

able to purchase ports, resorts, casinos, and other state properties to hide
their illicit proceeds and facilitate their criminal activities.

Reputation Risk for the Country

A reputation as a money laundering or terrorist financing haven can harm

development and economic growth in a country. It diminishes legitimate
global opportunities because foreign financial organizations find that the extra

scrutiny involved in working with organizations in money laundering havens is

too expensive.

Legitimate businesses located in money laundering havens can also suffer

from reduced access to markets (or might have to pay more to have access)

due to the extra scrutiny of ownership and control systems. Once a country’s

financial reputation is damaged, rebuilding it is very difficult. It requires

significant resources to rectify a problem that could have been prevented

with proper AML controls. Other effects include specific countermeasures

that can be taken by international organizations and other countries and

reduced eligibility for governmental assistance.

Risk of International Sanctions

In order to protect the financial system from money laundering and terrorist

financing, the United States, United Nations, European Union, and other

governing bodies may impose sanctions against foreign countries, entities,

individuals, terrorists and terrorist groups, drug traffickers, and other security

threats. In the United States, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of

the US Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and

trade sanctions.

Countries can be subject to comprehensive or targeted sanctions.

Comprehensive sanctions prohibit virtually all transactions with a specific

country. Targeted sanctions prohibit transactions with specified industries,

entities, or individuals listed on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and

Blocked Persons (SDN) list. Failure to comply can result in criminal and civil
penalties.

FATF also maintains a list of jurisdictions identified as high risk and

noncooperative, where AML/CFT regimes have strategic
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 12

Version 6.44

deficiencies and do not meet international standards. As a result, FATF calls on

its members to implement countermeasures against these jurisdictions, such
as financial organizations applying enhanced due diligence (EDD) to business

relationships and transactions with natural and legal persons from an
identified jurisdiction in an attempt to persuade it to improve its AML/CFT

regime.

Social Costs

Significant social costs and risks are associated with money laundering. Money

laundering is integral to maintaining the profitability of crime. It also enables
drug traffickers, smugglers, and other criminals to expand their operations.

This drives up the cost of government expenses and budgets to combat the

serious consequences that result, due to the need for increased law

enforcement and other expenditures (e.g., increased healthcare costs for

treating drug addicts).

Financial organizations that rely on the proceeds of crime face great

challenges in adequately managing their assets, liabilities, and operations, as

well as in attracting legitimate clients. They also risk being excluded from the

international financial system. The adverse consequences of money

laundering are reputational, operational, legal, and concentration risks, and

they include:

•  Loss of profitable business

•  Liquidity problems through withdrawal of funds

•  Termination of correspondent banking facilities

•

Investigation costs and fines

•  Asset seizures

•  Loan losses

•  Reduced stock value of financial organizations

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 13

Version 6.44

Reputational Risk

Adverse publicity regarding an organization’s business practices and

associations, whether accurate or not, will cause a loss of public confidence in

the integrity of the organization. As an example, reputational risk for a bank
represents the potential that borrowers, depositors, and investors might stop

doing business with the bank because of a money laundering scandal.

The loss of high-quality borrowers reduces profitable loans and increases the

risk of the overall loan portfolio. Depositors might withdraw their funds.

Moreover, funds placed on deposit with a bank could be unreliable as a source
of funding once depositors learn that the bank might not be stable. Depositors

could be more willing to incur large penalties rather than leave their funds in a

questionable bank, resulting in unanticipated withdrawals and causing
potential liquidity problems.

Operational Risk

 The potential for loss results from inadequate internal processes, personnel,
or systems, or from external events. Such losses can occur when

organizations incur reduced or terminated inter-bank or correspondent

banking services or an increased cost for these services. Increased borrowing

or funding costs are also a component of operational risk.

Legal Risk

There is potential for lawsuits, adverse judgments, unenforceable contracts,

fines and penalties that generate losses, increased expenses for an

organization, and even the closure of the organization. For example, legitimate

customers could become victims of a financial crime, lose money, and sue the

financial organization for reimbursement. There could be investigations

conducted by regulators and/or law enforcement authorities, resulting in

increased costs, as well as fines and other penalties. Also, certain contracts
could be unenforceable due to fraud on the part of the criminal customer.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 14

Version 6.44

Concentration Risk

The potential for loss results from too much credit or loan exposure to one

borrower or group of borrowers. Regulations usually restrict a financial

organization’s exposure to a single borrower or group of related borrowers.
Lack of knowledge about a specific customer, who controls the customer, or

the customer’s relationships to other borrowers can place an organization at
risk in this regard. This is particularly a concern when there are related

counterparties, connected borrowers, and a common source of income or

assets for repayment. Loan losses can also result from unenforceable
contracts and contracts made with fictitious persons.

For these reasons, international bodies have issued statements, such as the

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s guidelines on the Sound
Management of Risks Related to Money Laundering and Financing of

Terrorism and FATF’s International Standards on Combating Money
Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism & Proliferation.

Economic and social consequences of
money laundering (Case example)

In 2017, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, 21 people were indicted on sex

trafficking and money laundering charges. The organized crime group (OCG)

allegedly trafficked women from Thailand to cities across the US for sexual
exploitation.

The OCG dealt primarily in cash and conducted a sophisticated international

money laundering ring to promote, redistribute, and conceal illegal profits.

Funnel accounts were used to launder and route cash from cities across the

US to money launderers in Los Angeles. A funnel account is a money

laundering method that exploits branch networks of financial institutions. It

involves depositing illegal funds into an account at one geographic location

and giving criminals immediate access to the money via withdrawals in a

different geographic location. The transaction amounts are kept under the

AML reporting requirements in an attempt to avoid detection. In this case,

funds were withdrawn in Los Angeles and then wired, transported as bulk
cash, or mailed to Thailand.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 15

Version 6.44

Through the coordinated efforts of various government and enforcement

agencies, the human trafficking ring was taken down. The investigation
resulted in 20 arrests, recovery of victims from active houses of prostitution,

and seizures of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and numerous
weapons. The indictment consisted of predicate crimes including sex

trafficking, fraud, human trafficking, threats of force, and money laundering.

The victims in this case were primarily poor women with limited ability to
speak English. They were promised a better standard of living in exchange for

US$40,000 to $60,000 in bondage debt. Criminals gained information about

their families and used it to threaten the women and prevent them from
fleeing and becoming noncompliant.

The operatives of the money laundering ring helped their victims attain

fraudulent visas and travel documents by forging bank statements and

creating fictitious backgrounds and employment information. In the US,

victims were escorted by a member of the OCG organization to a bank and

instructed to open accounts in their own names. OCG members then took

control of the accounts and provided the account information to co-

conspirators to coordinate deposits throughout the US.

The OCG recruited money mules to carry large volumes of cash on trips to

Thailand and used a hawala system to transfer money to Thailand. The OCG

moved tens of millions of dollars in illegal proceeds from the US to Thailand

and elsewhere using this system.

Collaboration between law enforcement and the private sector is essential to

identify money laundering red flags. In addition, organizations must have

mechanisms in place to report suspicious activities to regulators and law

enforcement in the continuous fight against financial crime. Organizations

need to sufficiently train frontline officers to identify fraudulent documents

and red flags associated with human trafficking.

Money laundering undermines the legitimacy of the private sector and

weakens the financial sector, both of which are critical for a nation’s economic

growth. Criminals often exploit loopholes within various institutions to facilitate

financial crimes. This method undermines the legitimate financial system and

exploits various markets, such as the labor market. Money laundering also

promotes crime and corruption, which slow economic growth and cause

significant reputational risk. In addition, money laundering perpetuates other

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 16

Version 6.44

crimes, such as human trafficking and smuggling, fraud, and corruption. These

predicate crimes exploit and victimize vulnerable individuals.

Key takeaways

•  Money laundering promotes crime and corruption and slows economic

growth.

•  Money laundering exploits institutional loopholes and undermines the

legitimate financial system and markets.

•  Money laundering perpetuates other crimes, such as smuggling, fraud, and

corruption.

•  Collaboration among various agencies and the private and public sector is

necessary to fight financial crime.

AML/CFT Compliance Programs and
Individual Accountability

Regulatory guidance and legislation place individual accountability at the

senior levels of regulated entities when they have contributed to deficiencies
in AML/CFT and sanctions compliance programs.

In 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US

Department of the Treasury and the US financial intelligence unit (FIU) issued

an advisory to financial organizations, reminding them to maintain a strong

culture of compliance and specifying that the entire staff is responsible for

AML/CFT compliance. This advisory was followed in 2015 by a memorandum

on “Individual Accountability for Corporate Wrongdoing” from the US

Department of Justice’s Deputy Attorney General, Sally Quillian Yates.

The Yates Memo, as it is often referred to, reminds prosecutors that criminal

and civil investigations into corporate misconduct should also focus on

individuals who perpetrated the wrongdoing. Further, it notes that the

resolution of a corporate case does not provide protection to individuals from

criminal or civil liability. Although the Yates Memo does not specifically address
AML/CFT compliance, enforcement actions issued by US regulators against

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 17

Version 6.44

financial organizations demonstrate a continued focus on AML/CFT

compliance deficiencies.

In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published final

rules for the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR), which are
designed to improve individual accountability within the banking sector. In

relation to financial crime, the SM&CR requires a financial organization to give

explicit responsibility to a senior manager, such as an executive-level money
laundering reporting officer (MLRO), for ensuring that its efforts to combat

financial crime are effectively designed and implemented. The senior

manager is personally accountable for any misconduct within the
organization’s AML/CFT regime.

The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) issued a Final Rule

requiring regulated organizations to maintain “transaction monitoring and

filtering programs” reasonably designed to monitor transactions after their

execution for compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and AML laws and

regulations, including suspicious activity reporting requirements, and prevent

unlawful transactions with targets of economic sanctions administered by

OFAC.

This Final Rule, which went into effect on January 1, 2017, includes very specific

requirements concerning the implementation of transaction monitoring

systems, including:

•  Risk-Based Models: Models should be risk-based and commensurate with

the organization’s own risk assessment and profile.

•  Model Performance Calibration: Organizations must perform ongoing

analysis and testing of the AML/CFT models to assess the scenario logic,

performance, model technology, assumptions, and model parameter

settings.

•  End-to-End, Pre- and Post-Model Implementation Testing: End-to-end

testing is required to ensure rules are validated and data are complete and

accurate.

This Final Rule also requires regulated organizations’ boards of directors or

senior officers to annually certify to the DFS that they have taken all steps

necessary to comply with transaction monitoring and filtering program

requirements.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 18

Version 6.44

Although the law may seem New York-specific on its face, numerous foreign

banks are subject to the law because they operate in New York. Specifically,
the law covers banks, trust companies, private bankers, savings banks, and

savings and loan associations chartered pursuant to the New York Banking
Law, as well as all branches and agencies of foreign banking corporations

licensed pursuant to the Banking Law to conduct banking operations in New

York. Moreover, the law also applies to nonbank financial organizations with a
banking law license, such as check cashers and money transmitters.

Individual accountability and consequences
(Case example)

In August of 2020, the UK’s Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal suspended and fined

lawyer Steven David Kinch for repeatedly breaching his professional anti-

money laundering obligations.

It is well-known that several legal options exist globally to impose corporate

liability. For example, in vicarious liability, an organization could be found

criminally liable for the acts of its employees. There is, however, increasing

focus on individual liability for professionals when their behaviors and actions

encourage, tolerate, or lead to regulatory violations or criminal activity.

Individuals are now expected to conduct business responsibly and prevent

AML/CFT violations.

Individual professionals are increasingly being held accountable for sector-

specific crimes, through prosecution of linked financial crime offenses such as

fraud. They may also be held accountable for their organizations’ AML/CFT

failures. When prosecuted, individuals have been imprisoned, fined,

suspended, or debarred from professional activities in regulated sectors.

On August 12, 2020, the UK Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal suspended lawyer

Steven David Kinch for repeatedly breaching his professional anti-money

laundering obligations. Kinch failed to check source of funds and perform

customer and third-party due diligence when establishing new business

relationships. He did not review transactions while doing business with a

company incorporated in Sinaloa, Mexico. In fact, he stated that transactions

involving foreign nationals and overseas residents, in a location where he had

no connection or profile himself, did not raise red flags for him. He admitted

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 19

Version 6.44

that the nature of the transactions being conducted was out of his expertise.

Kinch’s actions amounted to serious misconduct with high culpability and
harm involving significant monies over a three-year period. Kinch was

suspended from practice as a lawyer for 15 months and fined £5,000, after
which he would be banned from practicing as a sole practitioner, manager, or

owner of an authorized or recognized body. He was also forbidden from

acting as a compliance officer for legal practice or finance and administration
for three years.

Compliance professionals must recognize the risks and specific accountability

that they personally face in their work environments. They should ensure that
they are fully up-to-date with legislative and regulatory requirements specific

to their role and sector. If they have any concerns regarding integrity or
behavior within their firm or business, they should escalate issues through the

appropriate formal reporting or whistleblowing channels and document the

fact.

Key takeaways

•  Regulators use powers to sanction professionals who commit crimes from

their sectors.

•  Criminal courts can impose a range of sanctions against guilty

professionals, including prosecution and imprisonment.

•  Accountability for money laundering offenses in a professional capacity

can have devastating financial, personal, and reputational consequences

for individuals.

Methods of Money Laundering

Money laundering is a constantly evolving activity; it must be continuously

monitored in all its various forms for countermeasures to be timely and

effective. Illicit money can move through numerous commercial channels,

including products such as checking, savings, and brokerage accounts; loans;

wires and transfers; and financial intermediaries, such as trusts and company
service providers, securities dealers, banks, and money services businesses.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 20

Version 6.44

Money launderers operate in and around the financial system in a manner that

best fits the execution of the scheme to launder funds. Since many
governments around the world have implemented AML/CFT obligations for

the banking sector, a shift in laundering activity into the nonbank financial
sector and nonfinancial businesses and professions has risen.

FATF and FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs) publish periodic typology

reports to monitor changes and better understand the underlying
mechanisms of money laundering and terrorist financing. The objective of

these reports is to provide information on the key methods and trends in

these areas and to ensure that the FATF 40 Recommendations remain
effective and relevant. This Study Guide refers often to these typologies

because they serve as clear examples of how money can be laundered
through different methods and in different settings.

Banks and Other Depository

Institutions

Electronic Transfer of Funds

Banks have historically been and continue to be important mechanisms in all
three stages of money laundering. This section outlines some specific areas of

interest and concern for money laundering through banks and other
depository institutions.

An electronic transfer of funds is any transfer of funds that is initiated by

electronic means, such as internet-based transfers, an automated clearing

house (ACH), an automated teller machine (ATM), mobile telephones, and

other devices. Electronic funds transfers can happen within a country and

across borders. Trillions of dollars are transferred in millions of transactions

each day, because it is one of the fastest ways to move money.

Systems such as the US Federal Reserve wire network, or Fedwire, the Society

for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), and the

Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) move millions of wires

and transfer messages daily. As such, illicit fund transfers can be easily hidden

among the millions of legitimate transfers that occur each day. For example,

money launderers might initiate unauthorized domestic or international

electronic transfers of funds—such as ACH debits or cash advances on a

stolen credit card—and place the funds into an account established to receive

the transfers. Another example is stealing credit cards and using the funds to
purchase merchandise that can be resold to provide the criminal with cash.

Money launderers also use electronic transfers of funds in the layering stage

of the laundering process. The goal is to move the funds from one account to

another, from one bank to another, and from one jurisdiction to another with

each layer of transactions—making it more difficult for law enforcement and
investigative agencies to trace the origin of the funds.

To avoid detection at any stage, money launderers can take basic

precautions, such as varying the amounts sent, keeping the transfers relatively

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 22

Version 6.44

small and under reporting thresholds, and, when possible, using reputable

organizations.

The processes in place to verify electronic transfers of funds have been

tightened. Transaction monitoring software providers have developed
sophisticated algorithms to help detect and trigger alerts that might indicate

money laundering or other suspicious activity using electronic transfers of

funds. However, no system is foolproof.

Following are some indicators of money laundering using electronic transfers

of funds:

•  Funds transfers occur to or from a financial secrecy haven or high-risk
geographic location without an apparent business reason or when the

activity is inconsistent with the customer’s business or history.

•  Large incoming funds transfers are received on behalf of a foreign client,

with little or no explanation or apparent reason.

•  Checks and money orders are used to receive many small, incoming

transfers of funds or to make deposits. Upon credit to the account, all or

most of the transfers or deposits are wired to another account in a

different geographic location in a manner inconsistent with the customer’s

business or history.

•  Funds activity is unexplained, repetitive, or reveals unusual patterns.

•  Payments or receipts are received that have no apparent link to legitimate

contracts, goods, or services.

•  Funds transfers are sent or received from the same person to or from

different accounts.

Remote Deposit Capture

Remote deposit capture (RDC) is a product offered by banks that allows

customers to scan a check and transmit an electronic image to the bank for

deposit. This product offers increased convenience for customers because

they no longer need to make a trip to the bank or an ATM to deposit checks. It

is common for banks to allow individuals to deposit photos of checks taken

with mobile phones. RDC decreases the cost to process checks for banks and

is part of a gradual transition away from paper-based transactions. RDC is also

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 23

Version 6.44

increasingly used in correspondent banking, because it streamlines the

deposit and clearing process. Correspondent banking is the provision of
banking services by one bank to another bank.

The convenience provided by RDC can be abused by money launderers
because they no longer need to go into the bank and risk detection. Money

launderers who have RDC capabilities can move checks with ease through an

account and possibly set up multiple imaging devices (e.g., multiple scanners
and permitted mobile phones), enabling them to allow other criminals to

process checks through the system. A money launderer might even arrange

for someone else to set up an account and provide him with the ability to
deposit checks. Without proper controls, RDC can also be misused to facilitate

violations of sanctions requirements, for example, by processing transactions
in a sanctioned country.

Although RDC can be used for money laundering, the more prominent risk

relates to fraud. Because RDC minimizes human intervention in reviewing

cleared items, it decreases the ability to identify potential fraud indicators,

such as an altered check and multiple deposits of the same item. Often, the

resulting fraud is not prevented but rather detected after it has already
occurred.

To control the risks associated with RDC, efforts must be made to integrate

RDC processing into other controls, such as monitoring and fraud-prevention

systems. In fact, this integration should occur with any new product offered by

an organization. This includes ensuring that items submitted via RDC are

reviewed for sequentially numbered checks and money orders without

payees, that the total volume of activity processed for an account via RDC is

incorporated into the overall transaction monitoring system, that appropriate

limits are placed on a customer’s ability to deposit checks via RDC, that the

product is offered to customers to whom it is appropriate, and that
appropriate action is taken quickly when fraud is detected via RDC items.

Correspondent Banking

Correspondent banking is an arrangement whereby one bank acts as the

agent of another bank in a foreign country. A local, or respondent, bank has

customers who want banking services in a foreign country, so it contracts with

a foreign correspondent bank to provide those services. By
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 24

Version 6.44

establishing multiple correspondent relationships, a local bank can undertake

international financial transactions for itself and its customers in jurisdictions
where it has no physical presence. Large international banks often act as

correspondents for thousands of other banks.

The indirect nature of correspondent banking relationships means that the

correspondent bank provides services for individuals and entities for which it

has neither verified the identities nor obtained any firsthand knowledge.

The amount of money that flows through correspondent accounts can pose a

significant threat, because the correspondent processes large volumes of

transactions for the respondent's customers.

Correspondent banking is vulnerable to financial crime, especially because

correspondent banks do not know the customers of the respondent directly

and rely on the respondent bank’s internal controls. In addition, less

information is available to help the correspondent recognize suspicious

activity.

Before establishing correspondent accounts, a bank should identify the

respondent bank’s owners and understand the nature of its regulatory

oversight. According to the Wolfsberg Group, a bank’s due diligence on a

respondent bank should be based on the respondent’s risk profile and the

nature of the business relationship with that respondent bank. Due diligence

should address specific risk indicators, such as the respondent bank’s

geographic risk, ownership and management structures, customer base, and

products and services offered. Furthermore, the determination of the level

and scope of due diligence that is required on a respondent bank should be

made after considering the relationship between the respondent bank and its

ultimate parent (if any). If the parent does not exercise substantial and

effective control, due diligence should be conducted on both the respondent

and the parent. The Wolfsberg Group has a Correspondent Banking Due

Diligence Questionnaire that provides a standardized set of questions that can

be used to perform due diligence.

Low-risk respondent banks might be offered a broad range of services, such

as cash management—for example, interest-bearing accounts in a variety of

currencies, international funds transfers, check clearing, payable-through

accounts, and foreign exchange. High-risk respondent banks might be
restricted to noncredit cash-management services.

The risks of correspondent banking include:
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 25

Version 6.44

•  The correspondent does not or cannot conduct typical due diligence to

know the customers of the respondent (Know Your Customer’s
Customer).

•  The correspondent does not have data on respondent transactions that

typically enable transaction monitoring controls to identify unusual

patterns.

•  The correspondent can identify the respondent’s regulators, but not
always the degree of supervision to which the respondent is subject.

•  The correspondent might have limited information on the respondent’s
anti-financial crime controls—perhaps through a questionnaire—yet still
needs to rely on the respondent to have and use sufficient, effective

controls on its customers.

•  Some respondents are, themselves, correspondents to third banks, a

practice called “nesting.” Nested accounts further shield correspondent

banks from knowing the parties involved.

Correspondent banking (Case example:
Methods of money laundering)

In July 2020, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS)

issued Deutsche Bank AG, its New York branch, and Deutsche Bank Trust

Company Americas (collectively Deutsche Bank) a US$150 million penalty. DFS

cited significant compliance failures in connection with the bank’s relationship

with disgraced American financier Jeffrey Epstein and its correspondent

banking relationships, including those with Danske Bank Estonia (Danske) and
FBME Bank.

In the case of Danske Bank Estonia and FBME bank, Deutsche Bank was found

to have failed to monitor these banking clients, despite rating its

correspondent banking relationships with them both as high risk. Billions of

dollars in suspicious transactions passed through Deutsche Bank’s accounts

and, in the case of Danske, significant flows were linked to money laundering

by Russian oligarchs.

Deutsche Bank’s internal compliance controls had flagged concerns with
FBME as early as 2005 and with Danske Bank Estonia from the start of the

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 26

Version 6.44

relationship in 2007. However, these concerns did not result in timely actions

to address the identified risks. In 2005 Deutsche Bank rated FBME bank as high
risk, yet Deutsche Bank identified 826 suspicious transactions associated with

FBME Bank after that rating.

FBME Bank declined to respond to Deutsche Bank’s queries regarding the

ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) of FBME Bank’s corporate clients. In one

instance, the US authorities determined that the UBO was a Russian
businessman associated with a Syrian military research and development

organization. Deutsche Bank exited the relationship in 2014 after the Financial

Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) mandated all banks in the US to cease
relationships with the bank.

Deutsche Bank was repeatedly warned of AML issues linked to nonresident

accounts at Dankse Estonia, including those with links to Russia. In 2010

Deutsche Bank increased the risk score for the relationship with Dankse

Estonia to the highest level, because it continued to see no improvements in

the bank’s nonresident portfolio. In 2013 and 2014, Deutsche Bank compliance

staff recommended that the relationship be exited, but no action was taken

until 2015.

Over US$150 billion was routed from Danske Bank Estonia through Deutsche

Bank. Deutsche Bank identified 340 suspicious transactions linked to Danske
Bank Estonia’s US correspondent accounts with Deutsche Bank.

The DFS determined that Deutsche Bank’s failures were caused by

inadequate AML/CTF policies and procedures for its correspondent banking

accounts. The correspondents failed to establish sufficiently specific criteria

to trigger termination of relationships, provide practical guidance to staff on

how to implement verification of respondents’ UBOs, and act on identified red
flags.

Key takeaways

•  Senior management support is essential for compliance officers to

effectively execute their duties.

•  Organizations that ignore red flags associated with a customer relationship
can suffer significant reputational, regulatory, and financial consequences.

•  Nested accounts are high-risk because

o  Correspondent banks should include periodic reviews of their

respondent bank’s AML/CFT framework as part of their larger AML/CFT

framework.

o  Correspondent banks need to undertake risk assessments and ensure

that their policies and procedures regarding respondent bank

relationships and their transactions are adequate to mitigate against

identified risks, especially in high-risk relationships.

Payable-Through Accounts

In some correspondent relationships, the respondent bank’s customers are

permitted to conduct their own transactions—including sending wire transfers,

making and withdrawing deposits, and maintaining checking accounts—

through the respondent bank’s correspondent account without first clearing

the transactions through the respondent bank. Those arrangements are
called payable-through accounts (PTAs).

In a traditional correspondent relationship, the respondent bank takes orders

from its customers and passes them on to the correspondent bank. In these

cases, the respondent bank has the ability to perform some level of oversight

prior to executing the transaction. PTAs differ from typical correspondent

accounts in that the foreign bank’s customers have the ability to directly

control funds at the correspondent bank.

PTAs can have a virtually unlimited number of subaccount holders, including

individuals; commercial businesses; finance companies; exchange houses, or

casas de cambio; and even other foreign banks. The services offered to
subaccount holders and the terms of the PTAs are specified in the agreement

signed by the correspondent and respondent banks.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 28

Version 6.44

PTAs held in the names of respondent banks often involve checks encoded

with the bank’s account number and a numeric code to identify the
subaccount, which is the account of the respondent bank’s customer.

Sometimes, however, the identification of the subaccount holders is not given
to the correspondent bank.

Elements of a PTA relationship that can threaten a correspondent bank’s

AML/CFT defenses include the following:

•  PTAs with foreign institutions licensed in offshore financial service centers

with weak or under-developed bank supervision and licensing laws

•  PTA arrangements in which the correspondent bank regards the

respondent bank as its sole customer and fails to apply its customer due

diligence (CDD) policies and procedures to the customers of the

respondent bank

•  PTA arrangements in which subaccount holders have currency deposit

and withdrawal privileges

•  PTAs used in conjunction with a subsidiary, representative, or other office
of the respondent bank, which might enable the respondent bank to offer

the same services as a branch without being subject to supervision

Use of payable-through accounts (Case
example: Methods of money laundering)

Payable-through accounts (PTA) are considered high risk because they can

be used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions

evasion. The misuse of PTAs significantly declined after many financial

institutions implemented strict controls regarding their use by correspondent

banking customers, based on individual and country risk. Organizations also

established stringent processes and procedures concerning the scope and

nature of permitted PTA activities, due diligence requirements, and

associated disclosures. Recent cases of PTA misuse are rare, but an historical
case provides a clear example.

Lombard Bank Ltd, a bank licensed by the South Pacific island of Vanuatu,

opened a correspondent PTA at American Express Bank International (AEBI)
in Miami, Florida. AEBI permitted the bank to have multiple authorized

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 29

Version 6.44

signatures on the account. Lombard customers had no relationship with AEBI.

However, Lombard offered its Central American customers nearly full banking
services through its PTA at AEBI. The customers were even given checkbooks

that allowed them to deposit and withdraw funds from Lombard’s PTA.

This is how the misuse of PTAs worked: Lombard’s PTA subaccount holders

brought cash deposits to Lombard representatives in four Central American

countries. Lombard couriers would then transport the cash to the bank’s
Miami affiliate, Lombard Credit Corporation, for deposit in the PTA at AEBI.

Lombard customers also brought cash to the Lombard office in Miami, which

was located in the same building as AEBI. That cash was also deposited in
AEBI’s PTA.

For two years, ending in June 1993, as much as US$200,000 in cash was

received by Lombard’s Miami affiliate on 104 occasions. AEBI did not know the

source of the cash being deposited by Lombard’s customers into the PTA.

This fact raised significant AML/CFT compliance concerns related to KYC, due
diligence, recordkeeping, and regulatory filing requirements.

In 1994, AEBI paid a multi-million-dollar fine for its connection to money

laundering by a Mexican drug cartel. The organized crime group imported

significant volumes of Colombian-origin drugs into the US and used AEBI's

PTAs to launder the money.

Key takeaways

•  PTAs often do not know the source of funds and customers’ identities.

•  Because PTAs can be offered to an unlimited number of subaccount

holders, the exposure of correspondent banks to financial crime is very

high.

•  When correspondent banks offer PTAs, they should set clear limits on their
use, depending on internal policies and the risk profile of the respondent.

Concentration Accounts

Concentration accounts are internal accounts established to facilitate the

processing and settlement of multiple or individual customer transactions
within the bank, usually on the same day. They do this by aggregating funds

from several locations into one centralized account (i.e., the concentration

account). Concentration accounts are also known as special-use, omnibus,
settlement, suspense, intraday, sweep, and collection accounts. They are

frequently used to facilitate transactions for private banking, trust and custody
accounts, funds transfers, and international affiliates.

Money laundering risks can arise in concentration accounts when the

customer-identifying information, such as name, transaction amount, and

account number, is separated from the financial transaction. When separation

occurs, the audit trail is lost, and accounts can be misused or administered

improperly.

Banks that use concentration accounts should implement adequate policies,

procedures, and processes covering operation and recordkeeping for these

accounts, including:

•  Requiring dual signatures on general ledger tickets

•  Prohibiting direct customer access to concentration accounts

•  Capturing customer transactions in the customers’ account statements

•  Prohibiting customers’ knowledge of concentration accounts and their
ability to direct employees to conduct transactions through these

accounts

•  Retaining appropriate transaction and customer identification information

•  Frequently reconciling accounts by an individual who is independent of the

transactions

•  Establishing a timely discrepancy-resolution process

•

Private Banking

Private banking is an extremely lucrative and competitive global industry.

Since the 2008 financial crisis, global regulators have placed greater scrutiny
on private banks and their services.

Private banking provides highly personalized and confidential products and

services to wealthy clients at fees that are often based on “assets under
management.” Private banking often operates semi-autonomously from

other parts of a bank.

Fierce competition among private bankers for the high-net-worth individuals

who are their main clientele has given rise to the need for tighter government

controls worldwide. Competition brings increased pressures on relationship

managers and marketing officers to obtain new clients, increase their assets

under management, and contribute a greater percentage to the net income

of their organizations. In addition, the compensation paid to most relationship

managers in private banking is based largely on the assets under

management that they bring to their organizations.

The following factors can contribute to the vulnerabilities of private banking to

money laundering:

•  Perceived high profitability

•

Intense competition

•  Powerful clientele

•  High level of confidentiality

•  Close trust developed between relationship managers and their clients

•  Commission-based compensation for relationship managers

•  Culture of secrecy and discretion developed by the relationship managers

for their clients

•  Role of relationship managers as client advocates to protect their clients

•  Use of private investment companies by clients to reduce transparency of

their beneficial owners

•  Clients maintaining personal and business wealth in numerous jurisdictions,

including offshore jurisdictions

•  Clients’ ability to utilize and control numerous legal entities for personal and

family estate planning purposes

Private banking (Case example)

In 2015, the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), fined
Barclays global bank for AML/CFT violations. These regulatory breaches

related to a £1.88 billion transaction that Barclays arranged and executed in
2011 and 2012 for several ultra-high net-worth customers. The customers

involved were politically exposed persons (PEPs) and should therefore have

been subjected to enhanced levels of due diligence and monitoring by

Barclays. However, Barclays did not follow its standard policies and

procedures. In fact, it applied a lower level of due diligence than was required

for customers with lower risk profiles.

The FCA fined Barclays more than £72 million, which included the amount of

revenue that Barclays generated from the transaction (£52 million) and

penalties. On the date of the fine, it was the highest AML-related fine the FCA

had ever issued.

Although the FCA concluded that the transaction was not linked to financial

crime activity, it assessed the transaction as high risk due to the involvement

of private banking, ultra-high net-worth customers, and PEPs, among other

factors. High-risk transactions and customers require EDD measures, which

Barclays failed to conduct. Barclays’ policies and procedures required EDD.

However, staff linked to the transaction did not follow them, and senior

management failed to oversee the handling of the associated financial crime

risks. Investigators claimed Barclay’s sought profit over compliance,

onboarding the clients as quickly as possible to generate £52.3 million in
revenue.

Barclays did not obtain the necessary information from the customers to

comply with financial crime requirements. Staff failed to establish the purpose

and nature of the transaction and did not sufficiently corroborate the source

of wealth and funds for the customers and transaction.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 33

Version 6.44

Barclays agreed to keep details of the transactions strictly confidential, even

within the firm, and to compensate the customers up to £37.7 million if it failed
to comply with these confidentiality restrictions. Few people knew of the

existence and location of the firm's due diligence records, which were
maintained in hard copy and not on Barclays' digital systems. This impacted

how the customer relationship could be monitored on an ongoing basis and

meant that Barclays could not respond promptly to the FCA’s request for
information.

The Barclays case exemplifies the fact that business interests should never

take precedence over compliance with laws and regulations. The close
relationships established in private banking often require a high degree of

confidentiality. However, compliance checks should not be reduced or
minimized. Strong AML/CFT compliance programs are successful only if

organizations follow the policies and procedures that support them. Failure to

follow regulations can lead to fines, even if no actual financial crime event
occurred.

Key takeaways

•  Business interests should never take precedence over compliance with

laws and regulations.

•  The close relationships established in private banking often require a

higher degree of confidentiality, but this should not reduce or minimize the

required compliance checks.

•  Strong AML/CFT compliance programs need organizations to follow the

policies and procedures that support them.

•  Failure to follow a robust compliance plan can lead to fines, even if no

actual financial crime event occurred.

Use of Private Investment Companies in
Private Banking

In offshore and international financial centers, private banking customers are

often nonresidents; that is, they conduct their banking in a country other than

the one in which they reside. Their assets might move overseas, where they
are held in the name of corporate vehicles such as private investment

companies (PICs) established in secrecy havens. PICs are corporations
established by individual bank customers and others in offshore jurisdictions

to hold assets. They are shell companies formed to maintain clients’

confidentiality and serve various tax- and trust-related purposes. PICs have
been an element of many high-profile laundering cases because they are

effective laundering vehicles.

The secrecy laws of the offshore havens where PICs are often established can

conceal the true identities of customers’ beneficial owners. As an additional

layer of secrecy, some PICs are established by company formation agents

with nominee directors who hold titles to companies for the benefit of

individuals. These beneficial owners could remain undisclosed and sometimes

are subject to attorney-client privilege and other similar legal safeguards.

Many private banks establish PICs for their clients, often through an affiliated

trust company in an offshore secrecy haven. Criminals can establish complex

shell company networks in which a company registered in one offshore
jurisdiction might be linked to companies and accounts in other jurisdictions.

Use of PICs in private banking (Case
example: Methods of money laundering)

In 2014, Israeli-based Bank Leumi admitted that it had assisted more than 1,500

US taxpayers in hiding their assets in Bank Leumi’s offshore affiliates in

Switzerland and Luxembourg. According to reports, for several years Bank

Leumi sent private bankers to the United States to meet with its US clients to

discuss their offshore portfolio and tax-mitigation strategies. As part of this

strategy, the bank assisted in organizing nominee corporate entities

registered in Belize and other offshore jurisdictions to hide their clients’ private

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 35

Version 6.44

offshore accounts and maintained several US clients’ accounts under

assumed names or numbered accounts. Bank Leumi also provided “hold mail”
services and offered loans to its US clients that were collateralized by their

offshore assets, which were not declared to US tax authorities.

As a result of the settlement, Bank Leumi was assessed US$270 million in fines

and ordered to cease providing private banking and investment services for

all US clients and accounts with US beneficial owners. This settlement led to
Bank Leumi selling its affiliates Bank Leumi Private Bank and Bank Leumi

(Luxembourg).

Key takeaways

•  Nominee corporate entities registered in high-risk offshore jurisdictions

are an attractive vehicle for evading tax obligations.

•  Care should be taken when dealing with assets associated with non-

nationals to reduce the risk of them being moved or placed to deliberately

avoid tax.

•  Facilitating tax evasion is a serious offense that can lead to large fines and
negatively impact a regulated firm’s ability to do business with certain

customers and jurisdictions.

Politically Exposed Persons

According to FATF, there are three types of politically exposed persons

(PEPs).

1.  Foreign PEPs: Individuals who are or have in the past been entrusted with
prominent public functions by a foreign country (e.g., heads of state or of

government; senior politicians; senior government, judicial, and military

officials; senior executives of state-owned corporations; and important

political party officials).

2.  Domestic PEPs: Individuals who are or have in the past been entrusted
domestically with prominent public functions (e.g., heads of state or of

government; senior politicians; senior government, judicial, and military

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 36

Version 6.44

officials; senior executives of state-owned corporations; and important

political party officials).

3.  International organization PEPs: Individuals who are or have in the past been
entrusted with a prominent function (e.g., managing director, secretary
general, executive director, chairperson, and president) by an international

organization, such as the United Nations’ six principal organs and multiple

specialized agencies, the IMF, the World Bank, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, and the Organization of American States (OAS), among

many others.

Relatives and close associates of PEPs are also considered to be PEPs. The
definition of PEPs is not intended to cover middle ranking and more junior

individuals in the above categories.

PEPs have been the source of problems for several regulated organizations,

particularly with regard to reputational risk, as the following examples show:

•  Eldar Mahmudov: The former minister of national security of Azerbaijan
from 2004 to 2015, Mahmudov accumulated substantial real estate

holdings in the UK, Spain, Luxembourg, Lithuania, and Cyprus, many of

them in his children's names. Investigative journalists estimate his total

worth at over €100 million. The majority of his assets are held by the ex-

official’s son and daughter.

•  ABLV Bank: In 2018, the Latvian bank was identified by FINCEN as a financial
institution of primary money laundering concern, pursuant to Section 311 of

the USA PATRIOT Act. According to FINCEN, it had facilitated money

laundering for years on behalf of corrupt government officials and other

PEPs from Azerbaijan, Russia, and Ukraine, namely by funneling billions of

dollars in the proceeds of corruption and asset stripping through shell

company accounts.

•  Najib Razak: The former prime minister of Malaysia (2009-2018) was
convicted of abuse of power and money laundering in July 2020 and

sentenced to 12 years in prison. He was found guilty of having been the

primary beneficiary of large-scale embezzlement at 1Malaysia

Development Berhad (1MDB), a state-owned development bank. Billions of

dollars were fraudulently withdrawn from 1MDB to fund purchases of high-

end real estate and luxury goods, and to make investments through
various shell firms.

Version 6.44

•  Diezani Alison-Madueke: The former Nigerian minister of petroleum

resources was accused of siphoning off billions of dollars from Nigerian
states' coffers. In 2017, the US Department of Justice seized US$145 million

worth of properties controlled by Alison-Madueke, including a US$50
million apartment in New York City and an US$80 million yacht.

•  Riad Salameh: In 2021, Switzerland, France, and Luxembourg opened

criminal investigations into Lebanon’s long-standing central bank governor.
In 2020, investigative media reported on Salameh’s more than US$100

million worth of domestic and overseas assets. In one example, a company

tied to the governor bought a stake in his son’s wealth-management
business and later sold it for a profit to a Lebanese bank under Salameh’s

supervision.

•  Lai Xiaomin: In 2021, former chairman (2012-2018) of Huarong, one of

China’s largest state-controlled asset-management firms, was sentenced

to death by a Chinese court for accepting US$227 million in bribes and

associated money laundering. He had allegedly invested a portion of the

proceeds in gold bars and luxury cars, and made large deposits into his

mother’s bank account.

•  Petrobras: A global commodities trader agreed in 2020 to pay US$135
million to resolve a US Department of Justice investigation into a long-

running bribery scheme in Latin America. The scheme involved kickbacks

to senior executives at Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company, in exchange

for confidential pricing and competitor information. Bribes were paid under

fraudulent consulting agreements by and to shell companies, using fake

invoices and offshore accounts.

•  Alexander Shestun: A Russian court in 2020 sentenced the former head of
Serpukhov District in the Moscow region to 15 years in prison. The court

seized 106 real estate properties, 642 land plots, seven vehicles, precious

metals, collection coins, and cash from bribes paid to Shestun by the local

business community.

Structuring

Designing a transaction to evade triggering a reporting or recordkeeping

requirement is called structuring. Structuring is one of the most common
money laundering methods. It is a crime in many countries and must be

reported by filing a suspicious activity report (SAR). The individuals engaged in

structuring may be “runners” hired by the launderers, that is, individuals who
travel from bank to bank depositing cash and purchasing monetary

instruments in amounts under reporting thresholds.

Structuring can be done in many settings and industries, including banking,

money services businesses, and casinos. “Smurfing” is a common structuring

technique that involves multiple individuals making multiple cash deposits

and/or buying multiple monetary instruments or bank drafts in amounts under

the reporting threshold to evade detection.

Cash structuring example

Structuring is one of the most commonly reported forms of unusual activity.
Well-known examples of structure include:

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 39

Version 6.44

•  A customer breaks a large transaction into two or more smaller transactions.

Henri wants to conduct a transaction involving $18,000 in cash. However,
knowing that depositing it all at once would exceed his country’s cash-

reporting threshold of $10,000 and trigger the filing of a currency
transaction report, he goes to three different banks and deposits $6,000 in

each.

•  A large transaction is broken into two or more smaller transactions that are

conducted by two or more people.

Jennifer wants to send a $5,000 money transfer. Knowing that in her

country there is a threshold of $3,000 for the recording of funds transfers,
she sends a $2,500 money transfer and asks her friend to send another

$2,500 money transfer.

•  An individual sends his fortune to another country.

Mr. Lee, a wealthy Chinese businessman, sends his gained wealth of US$1

million in sums of US$40,000 via friends and business contacts to a British

bank in London. The reason he does not deposit it into his own bank

account in London is that the Chinese government has currency controls

in place for transactions over US$50,000 abroad.

Foreign money brokers structure transactions by following these steps:

1.  A structurer, who is acting for a foreign money broker, opens several

checking accounts in country A using real and fictitious names. Sometimes

the structurer uses identification documents of deceased people supplied

by the money brokers.

2.  With funds supplied by the money brokers, the structurer opens the
accounts with inconspicuous amounts, usually in the low four figures.

3.  To allay bank suspicions, the money brokers sometimes deposit extra
funds to cover their living expenses and make the accounts appear

legitimate.

4.  Once the accounts are opened, the structurer signs the newly issued

checks, leaving the payee, date, and amount lines blank.

5.  The structurer sends the signed blank checks to the money broker in

country B, usually by courier.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 40

Version 6.44

6.  A structurer might open as many as two dozen checking accounts in this
fashion. It is not uncommon for brokers to have more than 20 of these
checking accounts in country A available at any given time.

7.  The checking accounts usually accumulate only a few thousand dollars

before they are cleared out by checks drawn by the money brokers to pay

for exports from country A to country B’s money brokerage customers.

8.  The availability of hundreds of these accounts to country B’s money

brokers leaves open the possibility that tens of millions of dollars could pass

through them each year.

Structuring (Case example: Methods of
money laundering)

In June 2018, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) agreed to pay a AUD700 million

settlement plus legal costs. At the time, this was the highest penalty in

Australian corporate history for breaches of AML/CFT laws. The Australian

Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) accused the bank of

serious systemic failures to report suspicious deposits, transfers, and

accounts. Those failures allowed millions of dollars to be laundered on behalf

of drug importers through a method known as structuring. Structuring is the

illegal act of splitting cash deposits or withdrawals into smaller amounts, or

purchasing monetary instruments, to stay under a currency reporting

threshold. Money launderers use structuring to avoid triggering a filing by a
financial institution.

In Australia, banks are required to file threshold transaction reports (TTRs) to

AUSTRAC for transactions of AUD10,000 or more within 10 business days. CBA

failed to report over 53,000 transactions that were run through intelligent

deposit machines (IDMs) from 2012 to 2015. IDMs are a form of ATM that

accepts cash and check deposits. These deposits are automatically counted,

credited into CBA accounts, and made available for immediate transfer,

domestically and internationally. AUSTRAC alleged that CBA did not limit the

number of transactions a customer could make per day; its IDMs allowed up to

200 bills per transaction. A criminal who inserted AUD100 bills could deposit up

to AUD20,000 in one transaction, which is well above the mandatory reporting

limit.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 41

Version 6.44

IDMs also allow anonymous cash deposits. A card from any financial institution

could deposit funds into a CBA account. That means a criminal could
potentially deposit millions of dollars through a machine in one day

anonymously. Because the money appears instantly, a user could immediately
transfer the money to another account, including an offshore account.

In May and June 2016, more than AUD1 billion in cash moved through CBA's

IDMs. Many of the transactions were deposited in amounts that fell below the
threshold transaction limit.

Prior to using IDMs, CBA did not carry out an AML/CFT risk assessment.

Despite an exponential rise in cash deposits and alerts raised by its internal
transactional monitoring system, CBA did not conduct a subsequent risk

assessment.

In addition, CBA breached its obligation to perform checks on 80 suspicious

customers. Even when structuring was suspected on CBA accounts, the

institution failed to monitor these customers and conduct EDD, as required
when a suspicion is formed.

Key takeaways

•  Structuring can involve many channels, such as IDMs.

•  Adequate controls must be in place to ensure proper monitoring and

reporting.

•  New technologies need to be critically assessed for AML/CFT risks.

•  Organizations need to limit the number of customers’ daily transactions

and the number of bills per transaction.

Microstructuring

Microstructuring is another method of placing large amounts of illicit cash into

the financial system. It is essentially the same concept as structuring, although

it is done at a much smaller level. Instead of taking $18,000 and breaking it into

two deposits to evade reporting requirements, the microstructurer breaks it

into 20 deposits of approximately $900 each, making the suspicious activity
extremely difficult to detect.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 42

Version 6.44

In the case of a Colombian drug cartel, the cash proceeds of US drug sales

were deposited into accounts in New York with linked ATM cards, which were
provided to associates in Colombia. Deposits were made on a regular

schedule, with the Colombian associates withdrawing the funds as they were
deposited and giving them to the drug lords. In one case in New York, an

individual was trailed by law enforcement authorities as he went from bank to

bank in Manhattan. When they stopped him, he had US$165,000 in cash.

Microstructuring red flags include:

•  The use of counter deposit slips instead of preprinted deposit slips

•  Frequent activity in an account immediately following the opening of the

account with only preliminary and incomplete documentation

•  Frequent visits to make cash deposits of nominal amounts that are
inconsistent with typical business or personal banking activity

•  Cash deposits followed by ATM withdrawals, particularly in high-risk

countries

•  Cash deposits made into business accounts by third parties with no

apparent connection to the company

Credit Unions and Building Societies

Credit unions, which are also known as building societies in some jurisdictions,

are not-for-profit member-owned-and-operated democratic financial

cooperatives.

Credit unions do not have clients or customers; rather, they have members

who are also owners. Credit unions serve only the financial needs of their

members and are governed by a “one-member, one-vote” philosophy. A

member must purchase an initial capital share of the credit union, permitting

him to access the products and services offered by the credit union. Credit

union membership is based on a common bond, a linkage shared by savers

and borrowers who belong to a specific community, organization, religion, or

place of employment.

Credit unions can vary significantly in both size and complexity. Some credit

unions have a few hundred members, and others have hundreds of thousands

of members with tens of billions of dollars in assets under management. Some

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 43

Version 6.44

credit unions focus on meeting only a few niche needs of their members,

while others offer a full suite of products and services to rival most retail banks.

Most credit unions focus primarily on servicing personal banking relationships

from within their community. Depending on their member eligibility model,
some also facilitate memberships for small-to-medium-sized corporate and

entity account holders, although credit unions are prohibited from doing so in

some jurisdictions. Generally, credit unions do not participate in trade-based
financing, facilitate correspondent banking relationships, or maintain large

corporate relationships, particularly those with international banking needs.

In many jurisdictions, credit unions rely on credit union centrals for a variety of
services. A credit union central is best defined as a trade association for credit

unions; it is owned by its member credit unions and helps to serve many of

their financial needs. Services might include those related to capital liquidity;

research, training, and advocacy with respect to regulatory obligations; shared

operational and back-office processes, such as check clearing; and electronic

funds transfer (EFT) processing. In general, they help to negotiate shared

contracts for common services, allowing many smaller credit unions to

leverage economies of scale that they would not otherwise be able to do.

With respect to regulatory requirements and oversight, credit unions operate

very similarly to banks in most jurisdictions. They have capital, liquidity, risk-

management, recordkeeping, and reporting obligations similar to banks,

although there might be minor differences between institutions that are

subject to the oversight of regional versus federal regulators and regulations.

Because credit unions are included under FATF’s definition of a financial

institution, national AML/CFT regimes that follow FATF’s recommendations

treat credit unions similarly to banks.

The United Kingdom’s Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) states

in its sectoral guidance that credit unions potentially pose lower money

laundering and terrorist financing risks, because they typically have a

restricted or localized customer base and offer fewer products and services,

with more limitations, than retail banks. Credit unions are also less exposed to

third-party transfers. However, the guidance notes that, while their limited

functionality and flexibility makes them lower risk for money laundering, these

restrictions might not fully deter potential terrorist financiers.

The guidance elaborates on how a risk-based approach should be considered

for credit unions and lists potential risk indicators to take into

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

consideration. One risk factor highlighted is adult parents or guardians who

use a child’s account to launder funds. Other risk factors include allowing
transfers to or from third parties; frequent cash payments; customers

engaging in large one-time transactions; unusual loans or savings transactions
(e.g., early repayment of a loan from an unknown income source); and

reluctance from a customer to provide evidence of identity or information

about the purpose or nature of the business relationship.

Given the services offered by credit unions and their connections

to employers, benefits providers, and schools, it is important to consider

whether a customer might have a reasonable explanation for not having
suitable ID and whether they might be considered “financially excluded,” i.e.,

unable to access the traditional banking system. The guidance provides
examples, such as a letter from the employer or school, which can help to

identify someone who is financially excluded.

Ongoing monitoring can potentially be easier for credit unions, especially if

they are smaller, because there is a narrower range of expected activity to

monitor against, and transactions are often processed manually, making it

easier to identify unusual activity. Additionally, smaller credit unions have fewer

organizational hurdles to overcome when reporting suspicious activity to the

nominated officer.

Nonbank Financial Institutions

Credit Card Industry

The credit card industry includes:

•  Credit card associations, such as American Express, MasterCard, and Visa,
which license member banks to issue bank cards, authorize merchants to

accept those cards, or both

•

Issuing banks, which solicit potential customers and issue the credit cards

•  Acquiring banks, which process transactions for merchants who accept

credit cards

•  Third-party payment processors (TPPP), which contract with issuing and
acquiring banks to provide payment-processing services to merchants

and other business entities, typically initiating transactions on behalf of

merchant clients that do not have a direct relationship with the TPPP’s

financial institution

Credit card accounts are not typically used in the initial placement stage of

money laundering, because the industry generally restricts cash payments.

They are more likely to be used in the layering and integration stages.

Examples

•  Money launderer Josh prepays his credit card using illicit funds that he has
already introduced into the banking system, creating a credit balance on

his account. Josh then requests a credit refund, which enables him to

further obscure the origin of the funds. This constitutes layering. Josh then

uses the illicit money he placed in his bank account and the credit card

refund to pay for a new kitchen. Through these steps, he has integrated his

illicit funds into the financial system.

•  A money launderer places his illegal funds in accounts at offshore banks

and then accesses the funds using credit and debit cards associated with

the offshore account. Alternatively, he smuggles the cash out of one

country into an offshore jurisdiction with lax regulatory oversight, places

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 46

Version 6.44

the cash in offshore banks, and accesses the illicit funds using credit or

debit cards.

•

In a report entitled Extent of Money Laundering through Credit Cards Is

Unknown, the US Government Accountability Office, the US Congressional
watchdog, offers the following hypothetical money laundering scenario

using credit cards: “Money launderers establish a legitimate business in the

US as a ‘front’ for their illicit activity. They establish a bank account with a
US-based bank and obtain credit cards and ATM cards under the name of

the ‘front business.’ Funds from their illicit activities are deposited into the

bank account in the United States. While in another country, where their
US-based bank has affiliates, they make withdrawals from their US bank

account, using credit cards and ATM cards. Money is deposited by one of
their cohorts in the US and is transferred to pay off the credit card loan or

even prepay the credit card. The bank’s online services make it possible to

transfer funds between checking and credit card accounts.”

Third-Party Payment Processors

TPPPs are generally bank customers that provide payment-processing

services to merchants and other business entities. They often use their

commercial bank accounts to conduct payment processing for their
merchant clients. Often, they are not subject to AML/CFT requirements.

TPPPs traditionally contracted with US retailers (i.e., merchants) that had

physical locations in the United States in order to help collect monies owed by

customers. These merchant transactions primarily included credit card

payments, but they also covered ACH debits and creating and depositing

remotely created checks (RCCs) and demand drafts. With the expansion of

the internet, TPPPs can now service a variety of domestic and international

merchants, including conventional retail and internet-based establishments,

as well as prepaid travel and internet gaming enterprises. Considering the

expansion of services and the fact that a financial organization maintains a

relationship with the TPPP and not the underlying merchant, it becomes

difficult for the financial organization to know on whose behalf it is processing

a transaction.

The types of merchants to which a TPPP provides its payment-processing

services can increase the TPPP’s vulnerability to money
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 47

Version 6.44

laundering, identity theft, fraud, and other illegal activities. For example, TPPPs

that provide services to telemarketing, gambling (e.g., online and physical
casinos), and internet merchants, as well as those that process RCCs for these

entities, might present a high level of risk to a financial organization, because
they carry a high risk for consumer fraud and money laundering.

Examples of risks posed by TPPP include the following:

•  Multiple financial organization relationships: The TPPP might maintain

relationships at multiple organizations, which hinders the organizations’

ability to know the entire customer relationship. This arrangement is

purposeful by TPPPs engaged in suspicious activity to limit the financial
organizations’ ability to recognize suspicious activities and exit the

relationships.

•  Money laundering: TPPPs can be used by criminals to mask transactions

and launder the proceeds of crime. One way to engage in money

laundering through a TPPP is to send funds directly to a financial

organization from a foreign jurisdiction through an international ACH

payment. Given the significant number of transactions conducted through

a TPPP, this activity might not be identified.

•  High return rates from unauthorized transactions: TPPPs engaged in

suspicious activity, and those being used by criminals might have higher

than average return rates related to unauthorized transactions. At the

merchant level, the criminal merchant might have acceptable return rates

compared to the percentage of the TPPP’s total transaction volume, but

when compared with individual originators, the return rate will be

significantly higher.

It is important to understand that credit card transactions, whether

conducted through a TPPP or other financial organization, do not need to be

significant in amount to be considered suspicious or unusual. For example,

there might be a high number of small dollar transactions, repeat customers

or donors with no discernible pattern, and customers who receive

international donations or other payments that do not match the information

provided by the customer when they described their business or the

customer’s historical activity. Therefore, it is important to have strong CDD,

EDD, and transaction monitoring controls to detect suspicious activity and
customers that fall outside an organization’s risk appetite.

Version 6.44

Money Services Business

A money services business (MSB) or money or value transfer service (MVTS),

as defined by FATF, transmits or converts currencies. These businesses
typically provide currency exchange, money transmission, check-cashing

services, and money order services.

MSB laws vary by jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, FinCEN defines
MSB as any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an

organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:

•  Dealer in foreign exchange: These MSBs provide currency exchange

services (e.g., US dollars converted to euros). They typically operate along

international borders, in airports, and near communities with high

populations of foreign individuals.

•  Check casher: Check-cashing services can be offered by retail businesses
or as standalone operations. Depending on the model, the MSB might cash

checks for consumers and commercial businesses. In addition to check

cashing, these MSBs might provide additional financial services so their

customers can pay bills, purchase money orders, and transmit funds

domestically and internationally.

•

Issuer of traveler’s checks or money orders: The issuer of a money order or
traveler’s check is responsible for the payment of the item and often uses

agents to sell the negotiable items.

•  Money transmitter: Money transmitters accept currency and funds for the
purpose of transferring those funds electronically through a financial

agency, institution, or EFT network. Money transmitters also include certain

business models involving money transmission denominated in value that

substitutes for currency, specifically, convertible virtual currencies (CVCs).

Examples of well-known money transmitters are Western Union,

MoneyGram, PayPal, and Coinbase.

•  Provider and seller of prepaid access: Providers of prepaid access arrange

for access to funds or to the value of funds that have been paid in advance.

These funds can be retrieved or transferred at some point in the future

through an electronic device or vehicle, such as a card, code, electronic

serial number, mobile identification number, or personal identification

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 49

Version 6.44

number. Prepaid access is also referred to as stored value. Prepaid access

can be open loop or closed loop.

o  Open-loop prepaid cards can be used for purchases at any merchant
that accepts cards issued for use on the payment network associated
with the card. They can also be used to access cash at any ATM that

connects to the affiliated ATM network. Open-loop prepaid cards

usually are branded with the network logo, such as American Express,
Visa, or MasterCard.

o  Closed-loop prepaid cards are typically limited to buying goods or

services from the merchant issuing the card.

•  US Postal Service: Because the US Postal Service sells its own money

orders, it is considered to be an MSB.

FinCEN published a Final Rule in 2012 to expand the definition of MSB to detail

when an entity qualifies as an MSB based on its activities within the United

States, even if none of its agents, agencies, branches, or offices is physically

located there. The Final Rule arose in part from the recognition that the

internet and other technological advances make it increasingly possible for

persons to offer MSB services in the United States from foreign locations.

Absent an exception, MSBs are required to register with FinCEN. FinCEN

issued additional interpretive guidance consolidating current FinCEN

regulations and related administrative rulings. FinCEN applied these rules and

interpretations to other common business models involving CVCs engaged in

the same underlying patterns of activity.

MSBs in Canada are defined as businesses engaged in foreign exchange

dealing; money transferring; and cashing and selling money orders, traveler’s

checks, and similar monetary instruments to the public. These MSBs are

required to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis

Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).

MSBs can range from small, independent businesses to large multinational

organizations. Organizations can either provide MSB services as their primary

business or as an ancillary service to primary retail store operations.

Businesses that provide ancillary MSB services typically include grocery stores,

drug stores, restaurants, and bars. The services provided by these businesses

include, but are not limited to, cashing payroll checks and selling prepaid
cards. Although many of these businesses have brick-and-mortar locations,

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 50

Version 6.44

the number of MSBs operating solely on the internet with no physical

presence or a network of agents is increasing.

Traditional MSBs typically provide services to the underserved or unbanked

individuals. The focus on this market leads them to locate their operations in
regions with limited or no banking services. Additionally, they typically provide

lower cost services compared with financial institutions for certain service

offerings. For example, engaging in domestic or international wire transfers
through a financial institution can be time consuming and costly for a

consumer. Conducting similar transactions through an MSB can occur quickly

and at a much lower cost. Additional services could include bill payments,
payday lending, and commercial check cashing.

MSBs can be categorized into principals or agents. Principals primarily provide

MSB services and act as the issuers of money orders and traveler’s checks or

the providers of money transmission. In the United States, principal MSBs are

required to have written AML policies, procedures, and internal controls;

appoint a BSA officer; provide education and training; conduct independent

reviews and audits; and monitor transactions for suspicious activity.

Agents are entities that seek to provide MSB-type services in addition to their

existing products and services. An agent could be a principal MSB because it

offers check cashing as its primary service but an agent because it provides

money-transmission services through a principal money transmitter MSB. For

agents to use money-transmission services, they must enter into an agent

service agreement with a principal MSB. An additional byproduct of the

principal-agent relationship is that it allows principal MSBs to expand their

business and reach a wider customer market without the need for added

overhead. Agents of a principal MSB are required to follow the same state and

federal regulations as a principal MSB (e.g., AML/CFT procedures and

suspicious activity monitoring).

Examples of how MSBs can be used by criminals include:

•  Fraud in the healthcare industry is rising. Healthcare businesses, such as
home healthcare companies, might engage in fraudulent practices by

presenting checks derived from fraud to check cashers that they know will

not ask for proof of the payee’s identity, will either not file or file false

currency transaction reports (CTRs), and will not report them to the

government for engaging in suspicious activity. The check casher can be

compromised by an employee insider or attempt to be business-friendly

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 51

Version 6.44

by avoiding complying with legal or regulatory requirements that are

considered to be burdens to its customers.

•  Criminals obtain low-cost workers’ compensation insurance policies by

grossly deflating payroll amounts. After securing certificates of insurance,
organizers rent the certificates to other individuals and businesses for a

fee. Because the policies are obtained fraudulently, employees are not

covered and are therefore left vulnerable to high medical costs when they
incur an on-the-job injury. The payroll amounts are then concealed by

cashing checks at an MSB that circumvents proper bookkeeping

measures. The criminal makes a significant amount of money to the
detriment of workers.

•  Money launderers use money remitters and currency exchanges to make

funds available to criminal organizations at a destination country in the local

currency. The launderer or broker then sells the criminal dollars to foreign

businesspeople wishing to make legitimate purchases of goods for export.

It is a common misconception that there is minimal oversight of the MSB

industry. In fact, many MSBs are overseen by a variety of national and/or local

regulators and often maintain compliant AML/CFT programs. In addition, they

are monitored by the banks with which they maintain relationships. However,

the scrutiny applied to MSBs can vary significantly, in large part due to the ease

with which some MSBs can establish their business. Additionally, many MSBs

are small (i.e., one-store operators) and might not have robust AML/CFT

programs compared with their larger national counterparts. For this reason,

one of the most important aspects of due diligence for a bank that is

establishing a relationship with an MSB is to confirm that the MSB has

implemented a sufficient AML/CFT program (e.g., procedures, training, and

suspicious activity monitoring) and is properly licensed and/or registered in

the jurisdictions in which it operates.

Use of MSBs (Case example: Methods of
money laundering)

Nonbank financial services, such as money services businesses (MSBs)

provide valuable services to facilitate remittances, conduct money changing

and foreign exchange activities, support areas that are underserved by the
banking sector, and promote financial inclusion for individuals who have

limited access to the formal banking system. However, the cash-intensive
nature of MSBs and the transactional nature of their relationships with

customers make this service attractive to financial criminals for moving illicit

funds.

The Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), the Philippines’ financial

intelligence unit, cited MSBs as high risk in facilitating criminal proceeds in its

2021 National Risk Assessment, particularly in relation to drug trafficking and

child and sexual exploitation. It highlighted that the frequent use of cash poses

a threat in concealing the source of funds and its potential associated links to
unlawful activities.

AMLC’s statement followed the US$81 million Bangladesh Bank Heist in 2016, in

which three MSBs, including Philrem Service Corp. (Philrem), facilitated the

movement of money from the heist via remittances from fictitious accounts

to casinos in the Philippines. This incident drove increased scrutiny from the

regulators on the risks posed by such entities and led to a more proactive
supervisory stance.

In 2016, the financial regulator Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), in its

campaign to combat illegal money movement via MSBs, revoked the licenses

of three MSB companies, due to "significant violations” in AML compliance.

Among them was Philrem; it’s licenses to offer services as a foreign exchange
dealer, money changer, and remittance agent were subsequently revoked.

AML rules and regulations covering MSBs such as Philrem have been in place

since 2011 in the Philippines and require MSBs to comply with the same

requirements as banks, such as risk assessments, CDD, and transaction

monitoring. The BSP and AMLC have since implemented new measures to

combat the risks of facilitating illegal proceeds via MSBs, including a

restructure and consolidation of the sector to strengthen its framework for

AML/CTF compliance.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 53

Version 6.44

In the Philippines, the fragmented nature of the MSB industry and its smaller

size means that principals and agents often lack appropriate resources and
experience and that, as a result, the understanding of the financial crime risks

associated with the sector is still developing.

Key takeaways

•  MSBs must comply with the same AML requirements as banks.

•  Small MSBs might lack resources and experience, leading to compliance

issues.

•  The cash-intensive and transactional nature of MSBs can facilitate money

laundering.

•  MSBs offer valuable services and are important for financial inclusion.

Insurance Companies

The insurance industry provides risk transfer, savings, and investment

products to a variety of consumers worldwide, ranging from individuals to

large corporations to governments. An important aspect of the way the

insurance industry operates is that most of the business conducted by

insurance companies is transacted through intermediaries, such as agents

and independent brokers. Insurers, with some exceptions, are subject to AML

requirements.

The susceptibility of the insurance industry to money laundering is not as high

as that for other types of financial organizations. For example, policies for

property, casualty, title, and health insurance typically do not offer investment

features, cash buildups, the option to transfer funds from one to policy

another, or other means of hiding and moving money. However, certain

sectors of the insurance industry, such as life insurance and annuities, are a

primary target of criminals who engage in money laundering and terrorist

financing. In several ways, the sector’s vulnerability to money laundering is

similar to that of the securities sector; in some jurisdictions, life insurance

policies are even viewed as investment vehicles similar to securities.

According to FATF, life insurance is by far the most attractive area of the

insurance sector to money launderers. Substantial sums can be invested in

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 54

Version 6.44

widely available life insurance products, and many feature a high degree of

flexibility, while at the same time ensuring nonnegligible rates of return. Many
life insurance policies are structured to pay a fixed dollar amount upon the

death of the insured party. In contrast, other life insurance products, such as
whole and permanent life insurance, have an investment value, which can

create a cash value above the original investment when the policyholder

cancels it. Such characteristics are of considerable value to honest
policyholders, but they also offer money launderers opportunities to legitimize

their illicit funds. Furthermore, the most frequently observed individual

typology relates to international transactions, demonstrating the cross-border
reach of insurance-related money laundering operations.

For criminals seeking to launder funds, life insurance products with no cash
surrender value are the least attractive. Products that feature payments of

cash surrender value and the opportunity to nominate beneficiaries from the

first day of the policy are the most attractive and therefore higher risk.

Annuities are another type of insurance policy with cash value. An annuity is an

investment that provides a defined series of payments in the future in

exchange for an up-front sum of money. Annuity contracts can allow criminals

to exchange illicit funds for an immediate or deferred income stream, which

typically takes the form of monthly payments starting on a specified date. In

both cases, a policyholder can place a large sum of money into a policy with

the expectation that it will grow based on the underlying investment, which

can be fixed or variable. Unit-linked policies and insurance wrappers are also

high-risk insurance products because of their high value accumulation and

flexibility in adding and managing assets.

Typical features of high-risk insurance products include:

•  Offers the ability to fold funds and assets into the policy

•  Full or partial underlying investments under the control of the customer

•  Can offer the option of asset transfers

•  Can have a high upper limit for the amount of funds held

Another indicator of possible money laundering in the insurance industry is

when a potential policyholder is more interested in a policy’s cancellation

terms than its benefits.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 55

Version 6.44

Vulnerabilities in the insurance sector include the following:

•  Lack of oversight/controls over intermediaries: Insurance brokers have a

great deal of control and freedom regarding policies.

•  Decentralized oversight over aspects of the sales force: Insurance

companies can have employees (i.e., captive agents) who are subject to

the full control of the insurance company. Noncaptive agents offer an

insurance company’s products, but they are not employed by an insurance
company. They often work with several insurance companies to find the

best mix of products for their clients and may “fall between the cracks” of

multiple insurance companies. Agents who are complicit with money
launderers might work to find the company with the weakest AML

oversight.

•  Sales-driven objectives: The focus of brokers is on selling the insurance

products; therefore, they might overlook signs of money laundering, such

as a lack of explanation for wealth and unusual methods for paying

insurance premiums.

Examples of how money can be laundered through the insurance industry

include:

•  Certain insurance policies operate in the same manner as unit trusts or

mutual funds. The customer can overfund the policy and move funds into

and out of the policy while paying early withdrawal penalties. When such

funds are reimbursed by the insurance company (e.g., by check), the

launderer has successfully obscured the link between the crime and the

generated funds.

•  The purchase and redemption of single premium insurance bonds are key

laundering vehicles. The bonds can be purchased from insurance

companies and then redeemed prior to their full term at a discount. In such

cases, the balance of the bond is paid to a launderer in the form of a

sanitized check from the insurance company.

•  A free-look period is a feature that allows investors—for a short period of
time after the policy is signed and the premium paid—to back out of a

policy without penalty. This process allows the money launderer to receive

an insurance check, which represents cleaned funds. However, as more

insurance companies are subject to AML program requirements, this type
of money laundering is more readily detected and reported.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 56

Version 6.44

•  One indicator of possible money laundering is when a potential

policyholder is more interested in the cancellation terms of a policy than
the benefits of the policy. The launderer buys a policy with illicit money and

then tells the insurance company that he has changed his mind and does
not need the policy. After paying a penalty, the launderer redeems the

policy and receives a clean check from a respected insurer.

The FATF Money Laundering Typologies report provides some additional
typologies related to the insurance industry:

•  Third parties that fund insurance policies (i.e., not the policyholder) have

not been subject to regular identification procedures when the insurance
contract was concluded. The source of funds and the relationship

between policyholder and the third party might be unclear to the

insurance company.

•  Some customers actually do not seek insurance coverage; rather, it is an
investment opportunity. Money laundering is enabled by using large sums

of money to make substantial payments into single-premium life insurance

policies, which serve as wrapped investment policies. A variation on this

method is the use of large premium deposits to fund annual premiums.

Such policies, which are comparable to single-premium policies, also

enable the customer to invest substantial amounts of money with an

insurance company. Because the annual premiums are paid from an

account that must be funded with the total amount, a life insurance

product with apparently lower money laundering risk will bear the features

of the higher risk single-premium policy.

In the insurance sector, most of the business is conducted through

intermediaries. As a result, often it is the intermediaries’ application of AML
regulatory requirements that is unsatisfactory.

When an insurance company assesses money laundering and terrorist

financing risks, it must consider whether it permits customers to:

•  Use cash or cash equivalents to purchase insurance products

•  Purchase an insurance product with a single premium or lump-sum

payment

•  Borrow money against an insurance product’s value

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

Securities Broker-Dealers

The securities industry provides opportunities for criminals to engage in

money laundering and terrorist financing anonymously, given the varying
levels of AML program requirements in different types of businesses and the

high volume of transactions. The world’s capital markets are vast in size,

dwarfing deposit banking.

FATF has strongly recommended money laundering controls for the

securities field since 1992, in conjunction with the Madrid-based International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), a global association of

governmental bodies that includes the Commodity Futures Trading

Commission (CFTC), which regulates the securities and futures markets. The

difficulty in dealing with money laundering in the securities field is that typically

little currency is involved. It is an industry that runs by electronic transfers and

paper. Its use in the money laundering process is generally after launderers
have placed their cash in the financial system through other methods.

Aspects of the securities industry that increase its exposure to money

laundering include:

•

International nature

•  Speed of transactions

•  Ability to conduct free-of-payment asset transfers, in which securities are

transferred without a corresponding transfer of funds

•  Ease of conversion of holdings to cash without significant loss of principal

•  Routine use of wire transfers to, from, and through multiple jurisdictions

•  Competitive, commission-driven environment, which, like private banking,
provides ample incentive to disregard the customers’ source of funds

•  Practice of brokerage firms of maintaining securities accounts as

nominees or trustees, thus permitting concealment of the identities of the

true beneficiaries

•  Weak AML programs that do not have effective CDD, suspicious activity

monitoring, and other controls

The illicit money laundered through the securities sector can be generated by

illegal activities, both from outside and within the sector. For illegal funds

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 58

Version 6.44

originating outside the sector, securities transactions for the creation of legal

entities can be used to conceal or obscure the source of these funds (i.e.,
layering). In the case of illegal activities within the securities market itself (e.g.,

embezzlement, insider trading, securities fraud, and market manipulation), the
transactions and manipulations generate illegal funds that must then be

laundered. In both cases, the securities sector offers money launderers the

potential for a double advantage: allowing them to launder illegal funds and
acquire additional profit.

Money laundering can occur in the securities industry in customer accounts

that are used only to hold funds and not for trading. This allows launderers to
avoid banking channels for which the launderer believes there are more

stringent money laundering controls. Other indications of money laundering
are wash trading and offsetting transactions, which involve the entry of

matching buys and sells in particular securities, creating the illusion of trading.

Wash trading through multiple accounts generates offsetting profits and

losses, as well as transfers of positions between accounts that do not appear

to be commonly controlled.

The FATF Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in the Securities Sector

typologies report identifies the following areas as presenting the greatest

money laundering vulnerabilities in the securities industry:

•  Wholesale markets

•  Unregulated funds

•  Wealth management

•

Investment funds

•  Bearer securities

•  Bills of exchange

Several compliance challenges that are unique to the securities sector

include:

•  Variety and complexity of securities: Security offerings are broad, with
some products tailored to the needs of a single customer and others

designed for sale to the general public. Products range from the simple

and almost universally known to the relatively complex and esoteric. Some

knowledge of the underlying security is typically required to address risk.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 59

Version 6.44

•  High-risk securities: Although most securities are issued by legitimate
companies, securities that are underregulated or established for
illegitimate purposes pose risks. In the United States, securities that are not

traded on regulated exchanges are typically sold over-the-counter, with
tiers such as “pink sheets” that require only minimal reporting. These

products make it easier to obscure information such as beneficial

ownership and make it difficult to determine associations with sanctioned
jurisdictions and companies. Securities firms are required to identify

securities that might pose risks and develop processes to restrict trading

of those securities, often on dozens of platforms.

•  Multiple layers and third-party risk: The securities industry involves many

participants, including financial organizations and broker-dealers, financial
advisors, transfer agents, securities lenders, custodians, introducing

brokers, and sales agents. The many layers of intermediaries, who may also

cross borders, make standardizing controls difficult and further challenge

overall compliance.

FATF has identified a number of suspicious indicators within the global

securities markets. Those particularly relevant to the securities sector

include:

•  A customer with a significant history with the securities firm who abruptly
liquidates all of her assets in order to remove wealth from the jurisdiction

•  A customer who opens an account or purchases a product without regard

to loss, commissions, or other costs associated with that account or

product, including early cancellations of long-term securities

•  A securities account that is used for payments or outgoing wires with little
or no securities activity (e.g., account appears to be used as a depository

account or a conduit for transfers)

•  A customer’s transactions that include a pattern of sustained losses, which

might indicate the transfer of value from one party to another

•  Transactions in which one party purchases securities at a high price and
then sells them at a considerable loss to another party, which might

indicate the transfer of value from one party to another

•  A customer who is unfamiliar with a financial product’s performance and

specifications but wants to invest in it nonetheless

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 60

Version 6.44

•  A customer who is known to have friends or family who work for the
securities issuer, or a trading pattern that suggests he might have
nonpublic information

•  Two or more unrelated accounts at a securities firm that trade an illiquid or

low-priced security, or “penny stock,” suddenly and simultaneously

•  A customer who deposits physical securities that (1) are in large quantities;
(2) are titled differently from the name of the account; (3) do not bear a
restrictive legend, even though the history suggests that they should; or (4)

lack sense in terms of the method by which they were acquired

Retail broker-dealers are the industry’s frontline defense—and its most
vulnerable access point. They are under constant management pressure to

expand their client base and manage more assets. The more assets in a

client’s account, the more commission will be generated. Money launderers

can potentially use this situation to their advantage by promising a large or

steady commission stream. Therefore, it is important for broker-dealers to

understand who they conduct business with and to monitor customers for

suspicious activity.

In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), as directed by the BSA’s

regulatory rules, implement requirements for broker-dealers at both small

and large organizations. These requirements compel organizations to

implement AML programs that include an appointed BSA officer, CDD,

suspicious activity monitoring, training, and independent audits. They also

subject broker-dealers to oversight by the SEC, FINRA, or both to monitor if

and how they are complying with the AML program requirements. Weak or

nonexistent AML program requirements can result in substantial monetary
and criminal penalties.

Use of securities (Case example: Methods
of money laundering)

In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined Deutsche Bank AG £163

million for the lack of an adequate anti-money laundering/countering the

financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) control framework between 2012 and 2015.

During that time, Deutsche Bank failed to obtain sufficient information about

its customers to inform the risk assessment process and ensure effective
transaction monitoring. The infractions and resulting loopholes allowed the

front office of Deutsche Bank’s Russia-based subsidiary, DB Moscow, to

execute more than 2,400 pairs of mirror trades between April 2012 and
October 2014.

The FCA identified significant deficiencies in Deutsche Bank’s AML control

framework. Its Corporate Banking and Securities division (CB&S) in the UK had

significant deficiencies, which contributed to the successful execution of the

trades. The deficiencies included:

•

Inadequate KYC and customer due diligence (CDD)

•  Failure to ensure that the CB&S front office took responsibility for its KYC

obligations

•  Flawed customer and country risk-rating methodologies

•  Deficient AML policies and procedures

•

Inadequate AML information technology infrastructure

•  Lack of automated AML systems for detecting suspicious trades

•  Failure to provide adequate oversight of trades booked in the UK by

traders in non-UK jurisdictions

The customers of the institutions in the UK and Russia used mirror trades to

transfer more than US$6 billion from Russia. The funds went through Deutsche

Bank in the UK to bank accounts located in Cyprus, Estonia, and Latvia. The

orders for both sides of the mirror trades were received by DB Moscow, which
executed both sides, or transactions, at the same time.

Investigators determined that the customers from Moscow and London who

executed the mirror trades were connected to each other. In addition, the

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

volumes and values of the securities were the same on both sides. The

customers were successful in changing rubles into US dollars and transferring
those funds out of Russia. Deutsche Bank should have recognized these

transactions as red flags for financial crime.

The inadequacy of Deutsche Bank’s overall AML/CFT framework and

governance made the fictitious mirror trades simple to execute. The

importance of a robust AML/CFT framework and testing for reliability and
effectiveness cannot be overemphasized.

Key takeaways

•

Inadequate AML/CFT frameworks allow abuse of the financial system by

criminals.

•  Real-time mirror trades involve the rapid transfer of significant sums of

money around the world.

•

It is critical to have adequate KYC and CDD procedures in place to identify

suspicious activity.

•  Organizations need to undertake continuous risk assessment and ensure
controls are in place to mitigate against existing, new, and emerging risks.

Securities and broker-dealers (Case
example: Methods of money laundering)

In June 2020, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) fined

Guotai Junan Securities (Hong Kong) Limited HK$25.2 million for multiple

internal control failures and regulatory breaches of AML regulations, as well as

its handling of third-party fund transfers, placing activities, and late reporting

of wash trades. Wash trading is the illegal process of buying shares of a

company through one broker, while selling shares through a different broker.

Specifically, the SFC investigation found that, from 2014 to 2015, Guotai Junan

failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate AML/CFT risks in relation to nearly

15,600 third-party deposits and withdrawals, totaling HK$37.5 billion.

The investigation determined that Guotai Junan did not respond to several red

flags indicating that certain third-party fund transfers it processed were

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 63

Version 6.44

suspicious. This resulted in a failure to monitor clients’ activities, conduct

proper scrutiny of the fund transfers, and report unusual and suspicious
transactions to the local financial intelligence unit (FIU). More than 5,000

deposits were made by third parties into the dealer’s client accounts without
documenting the depositors’ identities, their relationships with the account

holders, and the purpose of the deposits. Similarly, when two deposits were

made into a client account for the purpose of buying shares, the firm failed to
recognize that the funding was coming from a third party.

Maintaining a solid understanding of one’s customers and their business

operations, scrutinizing their activity for any discrepancies, and performing
KYC/CDD on any related and, particularly, unrelated third parties are key

elements of an organization’s AML/CFT program. Regulated entities are
required to know the beneficial owners of their customers. It is also important

to ascertain the source of wealth or funds in transactions. Guotai Junan failed

to do so on several occasions, for example when HK$28.8 million used by five

clients to purchase shares of a Hong Kong-listed company were deposited by

the same third party in amounts that well exceeded their self-declared net

worth.

Key takeaways

•  Ongoing transaction monitoring is a key component of an effective

AML/CFT compliance program.

•  Share offerings have associated risks for money laundering, insider trading,

and wash trades.

•  Both potential and confirmed breaches should be promptly disclosed to

the relevant regulator.

Nonfinancial Businesses and

Professions

Casinos

Casinos are among the most proficient cash-generating businesses. High
rollers, big profits, credit facilities, and a variety of other factors combine to

generate a significant amount of cash that flows from the casino, or “house,”
to the players and back. Where gambling is legal, billions of dollars can readily

flow between customers and a casino.

Casinos and other businesses associated with gambling, such as bookmaking,

lotteries, and horse racing, are associated with money laundering because

they provide an excuse for recently acquired wealth with no apparent

legitimate source. The services offered by casinos vary, depending on the

jurisdictions in which they are located and the measures taken in those

jurisdictions to control money laundering.

Money laundering through casinos generally occurs in the placement and

layering stage, for example, converting the funds to be laundered from cash

to checks and using casino credit to add a layer of transactions before the

funds are ultimately transferred out. A launderer can buy chips with cash

generated from a crime and then request repayment by a check drawn on

the casino’s account. Often, rather than requesting repayment by check in

the casino where the chips were purchased with cash, the gambler claims to

be traveling to another country in which the casino chain has an

establishment, requests credit to be made available there, and then

withdraws it in the form of a check in the other jurisdiction. Money launderers

can also establish casino lines of credit and use illegitimately obtained funds as
a repayment on the credit lines.

FATF has reported that gaming businesses and lotteries are increasingly used

by launderers. It gives examples of gambling transactions that enabled drug

dealers to launder their money through casinos and other gambling

establishments. One laundering technique connected with horse racing and

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 65

Version 6.44

gaming involves the person actually gambling the money to be laundered, but

in such a way that he is reasonably sure of ultimately recovering his stake in
the form of checks issued or funds transferred by the gambling or betting

agency and reflecting verifiable winnings. This method makes it more difficult
to prove the money laundering, because the person has actually received

proceeds from gambling.

Junkets, a form of casino-based tourism, also present significant money
laundering risk, because junket participants largely rely on third parties, or

junket operators, to move the funds across borders and through multiple

casinos. This method creates layers of obscurity around the source of funds,
ownership of the money, and the identities of the players. In some

jurisdictions, casinos might enter into a contractual agreement with a junket
operator to rent a private gaming room. In some situations, it is the junket

operator, not the casino, that monitors player activity and issues and collects

credit. Additionally, some jurisdictions allow junket operators to pool funds,

which obscures the spending of individual customers. In certain regions,

licensed junket operators act as fronts for junket operators in another country.

The front operators supply players to a casino through the casino’s licensed

junket companies, which might not qualify for a license in the country where

the players will be gambling. Such unlicensed sub-junket operators can act as

credit collectors and might have ties to organized crime networks. This poses

serious risk and can lead a casino to engage in informal arrangements with

junket operators that are inconsistent with AML/CFT policies.

FATF recognizes that several jurisdictions do not require licensing of junket

operators and their agents, further increasing the risks of money laundering.

FATF emphasizes the need to ensure that junket operators are not under

criminal influence and that financial transactions are transparent and subject

to relevant AML/CFT measures.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

FinCEN and FATF have identified specific behaviors to watch for, including:

•  Attempts to evade AML reporting and recordkeeping requirements, such

as:

o  A customer pays off a large credit debt, such as markers or bad checks,
over a short period of time through a series of currency transactions,

none of which exceeds the reportable threshold.

o  Two or more customers each purchase chips in small numbers, engage
in minimal gaming, and then combine the funds to request a casino

check for the chips presented.

o  A customer receives a payout in excess of $10,000, but requests

currency of less than $10,000 and the balance paid in chips. He then

redeems the remaining chips in amounts lower than the reporting

threshold.

o  A customer structures a transaction, often by involving another

customer, to avoid filing of a CTR or another tax form.

o  When asked for identification, a customer reduces the number of chips
presented for a cash-out to remain under the reportable threshold.

•  Using the cashier's cage solely for its banking-like financial services, such

as:

o  A customer wires funds derived from nongaming proceeds to or

through a bank or nonbank financial organization located in a country

that is not her residence or place of business.

o  A customer appears to use a casino as a temporary repository for funds
by making frequent deposits into the casino account and, within a short

period of time, requesting money transfers to a domestic or foreign-

based bank account.

•  Minimal gaming activity without a reasonable explanation, such as:

o  A customer purchases a large number of chips, engages in minimal

gaming, and then redeems the chips for a casino check.

o  A customer uses an established casino credit line to purchase chips,
engages in minimal gaming, pays off the credit in currency, and

redeems the chips for a casino check.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 67

Version 6.44

o  A customer makes a large deposit using small-denomination bills,

withdraws it in chips at the table, engages in minimal play, and then
exchanges the chips at the cage for large-denomination bills.

o  A customer inserts a high number of small-denomination bills into a slot
machine, known as “bill stuffing,” engages in minimal or no play, and

exchanges the voucher for large-denomination bills or requests a

casino check for what appears to be a legitimate winning credit from a
slot machine.

o  A customer frequently purchases chips with currency under a

reportable threshold, engages in minimal play, and leaves the casino
without cashing out the chips.

o  A customer transfers funds to a casino for deposit into a front money
account, withdraws it in chips at a table, engages in minimal play, and

then asks for the chips to be exchanged for a casino check.

•  Unusual gaming and transaction patterns, such as:

o  Two customers frequently bet large amounts to between them cover
both sides of an even bet, such as betting both “red and black” or “odd

and even” on roulette, betting both “with and against” the bank in

baccarat and betting the “pass line” or “come line” and the “don’t pass

line” and “don’t come line” in craps.

o  A customer routinely bets both sides of the same line for sporting

events (i.e., betting both teams to win); the amount of overall loss to the

customer is minimal, which is known as hedging.

o  A customer requests that a casino check be issued payable to third

parties or without a specified payee.

o  A customer makes large deposits or pays off large markers with

multiple instruments, such as cashier’s checks, money orders, traveler’s

checks, and foreign drafts, in amounts of less than $3,000, indicating an

attempt to avoid identification requirements.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 68

Version 6.44

o  A customer withdraws a large amount of funds from a deposit account
and requests that multiple casino checks be issued, each less than
$10,000.

o  A customer establishes a high-value deposit that remains dormant for
an extended period of time and then withdraws or transfers the funds.

The risk of money laundering arises not only from specific customer

behaviors, but also from the types of customers casinos conduct business
with. A player often builds a reputation as a high roller as long as they show big

play, without being subject to the due diligence necessary to determine the

source of funds. It is a serious mistake for casinos to allow play and accept the
revenue without reasonably determining the source of a customer’s gaming

funds. FinCEN expects US casinos to know the source of high rollers’ funds.

Even when they are not explicitly required to determine the source of funds, it

is recommended that casinos require more information from certain

customers who engage in high-risk transactions, such as international wire

transfers and large cash deposits, as part of a risk-based approach to

AML/CFT.

Through FinCEN, the US has become one of the most aggressive authorities

on issuing AML program deficiency penalties to some of the largest casinos in

the industry, for example:

•  Tinian Dynasty Hotel & Casino fined US$75 million (2015): The casino failed to
develop and implement an AML program (i.e., no dedicated AML officer,

failure to develop and implement AML policies and procedures, and no

independent tests of the AML program). The casino failed to file thousands

of CTRs, and its employees assisted wealthy VIP patrons in completing

suspicious transactions, particularly structuring.

•  Caesars Palace fined US$9.5 million (2015): The casino “allowed some of the

most lucrative and riskiest financial transactions to go unreported";

promoted private salons in the United States and abroad without

appropriately monitoring transactions, such as wire transfers, for

suspicious activity; and openly allowed patrons to gamble anonymously.

•  Sparks Nugget fined US$1 million (2016): The casino “had a systemic

breakdown in its compliance program” and disregarded its compliance

manager. Rather than file proper SARs, Sparks Nugget instructed the

compliance manager to avoid interacting with regulatory auditors and

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 69

Version 6.44

prevented her from reviewing a copy of the completed regulatory exam

report.

•  Artichoke Joe’s Casino (AJC) fined US$8million (2017): AJC senior managers
were aware that loan sharks were conducting criminal activity through the
card club and using AJC gaming chips for money laundering. They

nonetheless failed to file any SARs, although on multiple occasions loan

sharks had provided AJC chips to customers on the gaming floor in plain
sight. AJC also failed to implement adequate internal controls.

In addition to ensuring adequate recordkeeping and reporting requirements,

casino AML/CFT programs should establish a process that enables the casino
to reasonably determine sources of funds and allows CDD to be conducted at

the time the funds are accepted, often with a customer already on the

property and ready to game, rather than relying exclusively on an after-the-

fact back-of-house compliance investigation.

Although the concept of on-demand enhanced KYC and source of fund

questioning might be new to casinos, there are many ready-to-use tools

developed specifically for the industry’s front-of-house operations. The most

effective processes combine information from various international sources—

criminal and judicial, securities and exchanges, financial, government and

worldwide lists, political exposure, negative news, and business associations—

with ID verification, making the due diligence possible directly from the front

line of operations.

Online casinos and gaming operations are increasingly prevalent. Online

gaming is regulated in certain jurisdictions; however, many online gaming

companies operate illegally. In the United Kingdom, the Gambling

Commission requires a license for remote gambling when the business

operates in the UK and any part of its gambling equipment is located in the UK,

and when the equipment is located outside the UK, but the business operates

through a British-facing business. Online gaming is also regulated in Antigua

and Barbuda under the Interactive Gaming and Interactive Wagering

Regulations, and companies are required to establish compliance programs.

Nevertheless, online gambling provides an effective method of money

laundering for cybercriminals, because transactions are conducted principally

through credit and debit cards. Site operators are typically unregulated

offshore organizations. This can affect financial organizations, because the

internet gambling sites often have accounts in offshore banks
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 70

Version 6.44

that, in turn, use reputable domestic correspondent banks. Tracing the source

and ownership of illegal money that moves through these accounts can be
difficult for enforcement and regulatory agencies.

Due to the inconsistent regulatory environment and susceptibility to
cybercriminals, some credit card issuers do not allow the use of their credit

cards for online gambling. Financial organizations screen merchant codes that

identify the type of business accepting the credit card and transaction codes
for “card not present” (i.e., the cardholder is not physically in the casino to

process the transaction via a card reader). The bank can thus block internet

gambling transactions. However, online gambling can be funded in numerous
ways other than credit cards, such as prepaid cards, wire transfers, peer-to-

peer transfer, virtual currency, and mobile phone carrier billing.

MONEYVAL, the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money

Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism, identified numerous

potential typologies and red flag indicators for money laundering involving
online gambling, including the following examples:

•  A money launderer colludes with an operator of an offshore online

gambling operation and deposits funds obtained from criminal activities

into the gambling account and then withdraws them as winnings. The

website operator keeps a percentage of the proceeds as a commission.

The launderer declares the winnings to the tax authorities and then uses

the funds for legitimate purposes.

•  A money launderer deposits funds into an online gambling account using a

stolen identity. He bets using the funds and receives payouts for the

winnings or sustains acceptable losses.

•  A money launderer logs on to the gambling account from multiple

countries.

•  A player is identified as a PEP.

Casinos (Case example: Methods of money
laundering)

In 2019, the Australian Independent Liquor & Gaming Authority (ILGA)

launched an inquiry into the operations of Crown Melbourne, an Australian

land-based casino operator. ILGA alleged that Crown had actively facilitated
money laundering on behalf of extremely wealthy Chinese gamblers since

2014.

The inquiry highlighted the systemic failures of key AML controls such as

accepting large cash deposits from Chinese nationals at cashier’s desks in a

VIP room operated by a junket agency. Crown also incorporated shell

companies to facilitate transactions from China that were not reported to the

regulator, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre.

Whistleblowers leaked video of a cashier’s desk where a VIP customer

exchanged bricks of loose cash, totaling hundreds of thousands of AUD, for

high-value chips. Whistleblowers claimed similar transactions occurred

regularly in Crown’s VIP rooms, one of which was operated independently by

junket agents that recruited high-rolling gamblers from Macau.

Crown used two shell corporations to enable VIP gamblers and junket agents

to circumvent Chinese capital flight controls to credit casino accounts and

settle gambling debts. There was evidence that international criminal gangs

exploited these accounts to place proceeds of crime.

Crown staff often aggregated multiple deposits in one entry to hide from the

AML team the number and nature of transactions. Evidence of structuring

included nearly 700 deposits made below reporting thresholds, often the

same individual making multiple deposits at multiple branches on the same

day. Customers were allowed to deposit cash at Commonwealth Bank of

Australia without verifying identity or source of funds. Crown repeatedly failed

to report transactions exceeding the AUD physical currency reporting
threshold.

Key takeaways

•  Casino cashiers can be exploited for placement.

•

Intermediaries, such as junket agents and shell companies, can be used to

place, layer, and integrate funds through casino operations.

•  A VIP customer’s commercial value must not protect them from suspicion,

scrutiny, or AML controls.

Dealers in High-Value Items (Precious
Metals, Jewelry, Art, etc.)

The European Directives on money laundering provide a common framework

for including trade in precious metals, such as gold and diamonds, and other

high-value items, such as jewelry and art, within AML monitoring programs.

The USA PATRIOT Act requires certain dealers in covered and finished goods,

including precious metals, stones, and jewels, to establish AML programs.

However, in many other jurisdictions, these industries are not regulated for

money laundering control purposes.

FATF released a report entitled Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing Risks

and Vulnerabilities Associated with Gold, which reinforced prior typology
reports. Gold has high intrinsic value in a relatively compact form that is easy

to transport. It can be bought and sold simply and often anonymously for

currency in most areas of the world. It is more readily accepted than precious

stones, especially because it can be melted down into many different forms.

Gold holds its value regardless of the form it takes—whether as bullion or as a

finished piece of jewelry—and is thus often used to facilitate the transfer of

wealth. For some societies, gold carries an important cultural or religious

significance that adds to its demand.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 73

Version 6.44

Following are two of the key findings from the report:

1.  Gold is an extremely attractive vehicle for laundering money. It provides a
way for criminals to convert their illicit cash into anonymous transferable

assets.

2.  The gold market is a target for criminal activity because it is lucrative.

Understanding and knowing the various stages of the gold market and

types of predicate offenses is critical in identifying money laundering.

In industries that deal in high-value items, it is possible that transactions in a

particular scheme have not taken place at all, but they are represented with

false invoicing. The paperwork is then used to justify transferring funds to pay
for the shipments. The false invoicing scheme, whether overbilling or

underbilling for the reputed goods or services provided, is a common money
laundering technique.

The following transactions are also vulnerable and require additional attention:

•  Payments or returns to persons other than the owner: A transaction is

suspicious if one person delivers precious metal for refining and asserts

ownership of the metal and authority to sell it, but directs payments to be

made to another person. It is possible that the “dealer in precious metal” is

being used to transfer an asset not only from one form into another—

unrefined gold to refined gold or money within the international finance

system—but also from one person to another.

•  Precious metal pool accounts: These accounts are maintained by a small
number of large and sophisticated precious metal companies and have

worldwide scope. They receive and hold precious metal credits for a

customer, which can be drawn on by that customer. The customer can

request the return of the precious metals, the sale and return of monetary

proceeds, or the delivery of precious metal to another person. Thus, a

refining customer in one country can deliver gold scrap for refining,

establish a gold credit in the refiner’s pool account system, and

subsequently have delivery made by the refiner to another person, based

upon that credit.

The illegal trade of diamonds is an important factor in armed conflicts in

certain areas of the world, and terrorist groups can use diamonds from these

regions to finance their activities.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 74

Version 6.44

Individuals and entities in the diamond sector have also been involved in

complex diamond-related money laundering cases. As with gold, the simplest
typology involving diamonds consists of the direct purchase of the gems with

illegally obtained money.

Regarding dealers in high-value items, FATF reports that common types of

laundering activities include retail foreign exchange transactions, forged or

fraudulent invoicing, commingling of legitimate and illicit proceeds in the
accounts of diamond trading companies, and, in particular, international fund

transfers among these accounts. Some of the detected schemes are covers

for laundering the proceeds of illicit diamond trafficking. In others, diamond
trading is used as a method for laundering the proceeds of other criminal

activity.

The multi-million-dollar fine art industry can also serve as a convenient money

laundering vehicle. Anonymous agents at art auction houses bid millions of

dollars for priceless works. Payment is later wired to the auction house by the

agents’ principals from accounts in offshore havens. It is a convenient

mechanism for money launderers.

Art and antiques dealers and auctioneers can follow these tips to decrease

their money laundering risks:

•  Require all art vendors to provide their names and addresses. Require

them to sign and date a form that states that the item was not stolen and

that they are authorized to sell it.

•  Verify the identities and addresses of new vendors and customers. Be

suspicious of any item with an asking price that does not reflect its market

value.

•

If there is reason to believe that an item was stolen, immediately contact

the Art Loss Register, the world’s largest private database of stolen art,

antiques, and collectibles. The database contains more than 700,000 items

reported by law enforcement agencies, insurers, and individuals as being

stolen.

•  Critically assess the situation when a customer asks to pay in cash. Avoid
accepting cash payments unless there is a strong and reputable reason.

•  Be aware of money laundering regulations.

•  Appoint a senior staff member to whom employees can report suspicious

activities.

Use of precious metals and gems to launder
money (Case example: Methods of money
laundering)

Operation Apex was a US multiagency operation that in 2020 targeted two US

businesses and led to the arrest of 12 people. Individuals in the US, Hong Kong

SRA, Mexico, Canada, and elsewhere were alleged to be members of the Wu
gang, a transnational criminal organization engaged in wildlife trafficking, shark

finning, drug trafficking, and money laundering using gold, precious metals,

and diamonds.

The Wu gang allegedly trafficked marijuana grown in California to other parts

of the US and ran two companies involved in the illegal wildlife trade,
particularly shark finning.

Shark finning is legal in the US state of Florida, but not legal in the US state of

California. The Wu gang used false documentation to establish and use a

Florida shark fin business as a front for their California business, which shipped

fins to Hong Kong. Fake invoices and paperwork were created to make it

appear as though the Florida company was invoicing and financing the shark
fin business.

Couriers were paid shipping fees to take bundles of cash to be laundered. The

proceeds from the shark finning and drug trafficking were deposited into

third-party business accounts that dealt in gold, precious metals, and jewels to

hide the illegal activities. The accounts were held in financial organizations

located in the United States, Mexico, and Hong Kong SAR. Criminals often use

precious metals and gems to launder money because they make it easy to

transfer value across borders, they have high value in a compact form, they

hold value over time, they are easily transported, their origins are difficult to

trace, and they are easily exchanged for cash or used as currency.

Authorities confiscated US$4 million from the bank accounts of the two US

businesses, $US1 million in diamonds, and approximately US$3 million in gold,

silver, and other precious metals. They also seized about 18,000 marijuana

plants, 34.5 pounds of processed marijuana, multiple guns, and more than six

tons of shark fins.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 76

Version 6.44

Key takeaways

Converting illicit proceeds into precious metals and gems is attractive to

financial criminals because:

•  They have high value in a compact form, and their value tends to hold for

long periods of time.

•  They are easy to transport, so value can be transferred across borders

without customs declarations.

•  Their origins are difficult to trace.

•  They can be easily exchanged for cash or used as currency in most areas

of the world.

Use of precious metals to conceal drug
proceeds (Case example: Methods of
money laundering)

In 2018, a US gold refinery, Elemetal LLC, pled guilty to a charge of failing to

maintain an adequate AML compliance program, despite refining billions of

dollars’ worth of gold from multiple countries. Elemetal had a designated

compliance officer and an AML policy, but it failed to focus its associated

activities on the specific risks of the precious metals industry. Due to its

inadequate compliance program, Elemetal did not undertake basic KYC,

customer due diligence (CDD), or enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures

on its counterparties or establish the origin of the gold.

Elemetal forfeited US$15 million; was subjected to a five-year probation period,

during which it was banned from acquiring gold from outside of the US; and

agreed to implement a court-approved compliance and ethics program.

In 2015, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) highlighted the AML risks

inherent in the gold trade, due to its heavy reliance on cash as a method of

exchange, the anonymity of the properties of gold making, and the extreme

difficulty of tracing the origins of gold. US federal law requires precious metal

dealers to maintain AML programs, recognizing the high risks of money
laundering associated with gold.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 77

Version 6.44

In 2018, Elemetal admitted that it had failed to implement an adequate AML

compliance program, leading to significant KYC, CDD, and EDD failures.
Elemetal had acquired gold from overseas suppliers, including those in Central

America, South America, and the Caribbean. However, it had not obtained
confirmation of the suppliers' identities or the source and origin of the gold, in

contravention of the KYC requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).

Elemetal sourced gold from suppliers for which AML screening would likely
have flagged suspicious activity. It also accepted gold from countries and

customers where records indicated the gold was likely being smuggled

across borders. Elemetal accepted gold from suppliers for whom criminality
was suspected due to negative press indicating they were trading in illicit gold.

Three former employees also pled guilty to importing illicit gold from South
America into the US. These employees smuggled the illicit gold through an

Elemetal subsidiary in Miami, falsified paperwork, and bribed South American

officials. The three received prison sentences ranging from six to seven and a
half years..

Following the court case, Elemetal was removed from the London Bullion

Market Association’s list of gold refiners, from which buyers typically select

their suppliers. COMEX, the largest gold futures market in the world, also

refused to take gold from Elemetal.

Key takeaways

•  US federal law requires precious metal dealers to maintain robust AML

programs.

•  AML risks inherent in the gold trade include heavy reliance on cash,
anonymity, and difficulty tracing the source and origin of gold.

•  The BSA requires precious metals dealers to perform KYC on suppliers and

identify the source and origin of metals.

•

In addition to KYC, AML programs must also implement Know Your

Employee controls.

•  Failure to implement robust AML controls can lead to significant fines, loss

of business, and reputational damage.

Use of art to launder money (Case example:
Methods of money laundering)

For several reasons, criminals consider the world of fine art and antiquities an

attractive avenue for money laundering. It is a market that often operates with

anonymity, such as private sales with third parties. It involves high-value goods
with prices that are open to manipulation and subjectivity, and funding

sources can be opaque. The art world also is spread throughout multiple
international markets and commonly uses intermediaries and offshore

accounts. Historically, a lack of regulation and supervision has been used to

legitimize criminal activity in this market.

However, as increased regulation has made traditional methods of money

laundering more difficult, the art world has attracted money launderers. There

have been relatively few criminal convictions for money laundering in art and

antiquities, but there have been several high-profile trials for theft and fraud in

these markets. The art market has attracted the attention of regulators, and

global authorities have enacted laws to prevent its misuse by organized

criminals and terrorists.

In 2016, US biodiesel businessman Philip Rivkin pled guilty in Houston, Texas, to

laundering US$78 million through many avenues, including purchasing over

2,000 pieces of art. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and fined

US$138 million in restitution and forfeiture. Investigators determined that

Rivkin’s company Green Diesel was not in fact producing biodiesel, but merely

selling certificates and defrauding its customers. Rivkin sold falsified energy

credits to large companies. With the proceeds, he bought a collection of

photography worth over US$15 million, using the art to legitimize his income.

The Panama Papers scandal—the 2016 leak of millions of files from an offshore

law firm—suggested connections between art and money laundering by

identifying suspicious shell companies that were investing in high-value art. A

2020 US Senate investigation determined that, within months of the US

imposing sanctions on the Russian brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, they

illegally spent more than US$18 million on art in the US using shell companies
linked to Russian oligarchs to evade sanctions.

The US, through the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, has designated art

markets as high-risk environments for money laundering and terrorist

financing, as have the UK and the EU. These countries have promoted

prevention through enhanced supervision and regulatory requirements. The
EU, in response to the Fifth Directive regarding money laundering, released

the Responsible Art Market Initiative, a set of guidelines on combatting money
laundering and terrorist financing in the art market. As of January 2020, the

Directive puts art market participants in the same category as financial

institutions and estate agents. They now must register with regulators,
perform due diligence on buyers and sellers, and take a risk-based approach

to prevent money laundering.

Art dealers and associated financial services must understand money
laundering methods and recognize red flags and the potential risks to their

businesses. Many have invested in technology to assist with performing CDD,
verification, and appropriate risk assessments. Still, the responsibility for due

diligence remains with the art market participants.

Key takeaways

•  Art markets are high risk. They are linked to serious criminal and terrorist
offenses, due to the perceived anonymity of transactions, high value, and

international movement of goods.

•  Shell companies are often used to enhance secrecy.

•  Governments have introduced primary and secondary legislation to

regulate and enforce money laundering and terrorist financing standards

across the art markets, including the following:

o  The Responsible Art Market Initiative
o  The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020
o  The EU Fifth Directive

•  Art market participants are expected to understand the anti-money

laundering requirements and are personally liable for noncompliance.

Travel Agencies and Websites

Travel agencies and their websites can also be used by money launderers to

mix illegal funds with clean money to make the illegal funds appear legitimate,
by providing a reason to purchase high-priced airline tickets, hotels, and other

vacation expenses.

Money laundering can occur in travel agencies and through their websites in
the following ways:

•  Purchasing an expensive airline ticket for another person who then asks for

a refund

•  Paying for services in installments that are actually structured wire

transfers in amounts small enough to avoid recordkeeping requirements, a

method used especially by criminals from foreign countries

•  Establishing tour operator networks with false bookings and

documentation to justify significant payments from foreign travel groups

Travel agencies (Case example: Methods of
money laundering)

In 2015, Indonesian militant suspect Gigih Rahmat Dewe opened a travel

agency on Bintan Island, Indonesia, as a cover for the terrorist organization the

Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The agency was initially funded by

US$2,800 provided by Dewe’s handler, Bahrun Naim, an ISIS operative in Syria

who was known to have been involved in several terrorist plots in Indonesia.

The travel agency’s mission was to facilitate the safe travel of terrorists to their

assignments, provide a legitimate cover for money laundering, and generate

revenue to fund terrorist attacks. The plan only worked for a few months

before the Indonesian National Police’s counter-terrorism squad arrested

Dewe and his accomplices for planning an attack on the Marina Bay Sands, a

luxury hotel in Singapore.

Small travel agencies, especially in developing countries, are cash-intensive

businesses that offer the same opportunities as other cash-intensive

businesses to money launderers and terrorists. They also offer opportunities

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 81

Version 6.44

for terrorists to address logistical challenges, such as planning travel for

terrorists and entering false identities into travel arrangements, all while
limiting the risk of detection. ISIS created the travel agency in Indonesia to

facilitate safe travel for terrorists and avoid detection.

As cash-intensive businesses, travel agencies also provide the ability to

commingle legitimate and illegitimate funds and therefore launder money.

This method can be used during all three stages of money laundering,
because travel arrangements can be paid for in cash or by third parties and

later refunded by known airlines or hotel chains in wire transfers. This transfer

of funds would raise minimal suspicion at recipient banks. Payments are
overseen by the criminals controlling the travel agency, so the cash and third-

party payments can be hidden.

Key takeaways

•  Travel agencies are cash-intensive businesses.

•  Travel agencies solve logistics problems for terrorists.

•  Travel agencies can allow the use of false identities.

•  Travel agencies can be used to commingle legitimate and illegitimate fund.

•  Travel agencies can be used in all three stages of money laundering.

Vehicle Sales

The vehicle sales industry includes sellers and brokers of new vehicles, such as

automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles; new aircraft, including fixed-wing
airplanes and helicopters; new boats and ships; and used vehicles.

Money laundering risks, methods, and red flags in the vehicle sales industry

include:

•  Structuring cash deposits below the reporting threshold

•  Purchasing vehicles with sequentially numbered checks or money orders

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 82

Version 6.44

•  Trading in vehicles and conducting successive transactions of buying and
selling new and used vehicles to produce complex layers of transactions

•  Accepting third-party payments, particularly from jurisdictions with

ineffective money laundering controls

Most money laundering cases involving vehicle dealers have one common

element: the unreported use of currency to pay for the automobiles.

Cases have also occurred in which car dealers laundered money by allowing
drug dealers to trade in cars for less expensive models and to be paid in

checks, not cash, for the difference. In one such down-trading money

laundering scheme, a drug dealer traded in his US$37,000 Porsche for a
US$17,000 Ford Bronco. The car dealer allowed the down-trade, knowing that

the customer was a drug dealer, in violation of the anti-money laundering law.

Luxury vehicles (Case example: Methods of
money laundering)

In May 2019, a US federal court sentenced John D. Leontaritis, a resident of

Texas, to 20 years in federal prison. He was convicted of drug trafficking and

money laundering violations that were committed from 2013 to 2017 in Texas.

A jury had found Leontaritis guilty of conspiracy to possess drugs with the

intent to distribute, the distribution of methamphetamine, and conspiracy to

commit money laundering. The latter offense included using his luxury car

dealership to launder the proceeds of drug sales for the benefit of a sprawling
interstate drug trafficking network.

Leontaritis was the owner and operator of Vanderhall Exotics of Houston LLC,

which specialized in exotic luxury automobiles. He used his car dealership to

launder drug money for a large Houston-based drug trafficking organization

that smuggled drugs from Mexico into the US.

Leontaritis knowingly laundered drug profits through his business by regularly

accepting cash payments from known drug dealers in exchange for high-

value vehicles. As part of the conspiracy, Leontaritis used fraudulent dealer

invoices to hide the true identities of the buyers from law enforcement and

the Internal Revenue Service and failed to report cash payments for vehicles.
The conspiracy operated for many years and involved hundreds of kilograms

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 83

Version 6.44

of Mexican-origin methamphetamine. Leontaritis laundered millions of dollars

through the dealership before his criminal enterprise was dismantled by the
US Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.

Key takeaways

•  Cash-intensive businesses, such as car dealerships, are particularly

vulnerable to money laundering.

•  Fraudulent invoices can be used to hide buyers’ identities.

•  The purchase of luxury vehicles and other assets can be used to place
large amounts of illicit money into the financial system seemingly
legitimately.

Gatekeepers: Notaries, Accountants,
Auditors, and Lawyers

Many professionals have the ability to either block or facilitate the entry of

illegitimate money into the financial system, including lawyers, accountants,

company formation agents, auditors, and other financial intermediaries.

The responsibilities of such gatekeepers include identifying clients,

conducting due diligence on their clients, maintaining records about their

clients, and reporting suspicious client activities. Some of these obligations

also prohibit gatekeepers from informing, or “tipping off,” clients who are the

subject of SARs. Violations can subject gatekeepers to prosecution, fines, and
even imprisonment.

In European Union countries and several others, mandatory anti-money

laundering duties apply to gatekeepers. FATF’s 40 Recommendations (see

the chapter “Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism

Compliance Programs” for more on the Recommendations) also cover
independent lawyers, legal professionals, and other gatekeepers.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 84

Version 6.44

FATF identified the following functions provided by lawyers, notaries,

accountants, and other professionals as the most useful to potential money
launderers:

•  Creating and managing corporate vehicles and other complex legal

arrangements, such as trusts, which might obscure the links between the

proceeds of a crime and the perpetrator

•  Buying or selling property: Property transfers can serve as the cover for
illegal fund transfers (layering stage) or the final investment of proceeds

after they pass through the initial laundering process (integration stage).

•  Performing financial transactions: These professionals might carry out

various financial operations on behalf of a client (e.g., issuing and cashing

checks, making deposits, withdrawing funds from accounts, engaging in

retail foreign exchange operations, buying and selling stock, and sending

and receiving international funds transfers).

•  Providing financial and tax advice: Criminals with large amounts of money

to invest might pose as legitimate businesspeople to minimize tax liabilities

or place assets out of reach in order to avoid future liabilities.

•  Providing introductions to financial organizations

•  Undertaking certain litigation

•  Setting up and managing charities

Criminals often use legal professionals to give the appearance of

respectability in order to dissuade questioning or suspicion from financial

organizations and to create an added step in the chain of any possible

investigations. Additionally, legal professionals might deliberately misuse a

client’s legitimate accounts to conduct transactions without the client’s

knowledge.

The FATF report also describes five categories of red flag indicators of money

laundering or terrorism financing:

1.  Characteristics of the client:

•  Overly secretive

•  Uses an agent or an intermediary or avoids personal contact without a

logical reason

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 85

Version 6.44

•  Reluctant to provide or refuses to provide information or documents

usually required to enable the execution of a transaction

•  Holds or has previously held a senior public position or has professional

or family ties to such individuals

•  Known to have been the subject of investigation for an acquisitive crime
(i.e., one in which the offender derives material gain from the crime,

such as theft or embezzlement)

•  Known to have ties to criminals

•  Shows unusual interest and asks repeated questions on the procedures

for applying ordinary standards

2.  Characteristics of the involved parties:

•  Native to, residents in, or incorporated in a high-risk country

•  Connected without an apparent business reason; that is, tied in a way

that generates doubts as to the real nature of the transaction

•  Appear in multiple transactions over a short period of time

•

Incapacitated or under legal age, with no logical explanation for their

involvement

•  Attempt to disguise the real owner or parties to the transaction

•  Not directing the transaction, (i.e., the person directing the operation is

not one of the formal parties to the transaction)

•  Do not appear to be suitable representatives

3.  Characteristics of the source of funds:

•  Provided using unusual payment arrangements

•  Collateral located in a high-risk jurisdiction

•  Represents a significant increase in capital for a recently incorporated

company, including foreign capital, without a logical explanation

•  Represents unusually high capital in comparison with similar businesses

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 86

Version 6.44

•  Stems from a security transferred with an excessively high or low price

attached

•  Stems from large financial transactions that cannot be justified by the

corporate purpose

4.  Characteristics of the lawyer:

•  Located at a significant distance from the client or transaction without a

legitimate or economic reason

•  Little or no experience in providing the specific services needed

•  Being paid substantially higher than usual fees without a legitimate

reason

•  Frequently changed by the client, or the client has multiple legal

advisors without legitimate reason

•  Provides services previous refused by another professional

5.  Characteristics of the retainer:

•  Transactions that are unusual with regard to the type of operation and

the transaction’s typical size, frequency, or execution

•  Transactions that do not correspond to the client’s normal business

activities and show that he does not have a suitable knowledge of the

nature, object, or purpose of the professional performance requested

•  Creation of complicated ownership structures or structures with

involvement of multiple jurisdictions without a legitimate or economic

reason

•  Client transaction history with no documentation to support company

activities

•

Inconsistencies and unexplained last-minute changes to instructions

•  No sensible commercial, financial, or tax reason for the transactions or
increased complexity that unnecessarily results in higher taxes or fees

•  Exclusively keeping documents or other goods, or holding large

deposits or otherwise using the client account without provision of legal

services

•  Abandoned transactions without concern for fee level or after the

receipt of funds

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

Page 87

•  Power of attorney sought for the administration or disposal of assets

under unusual circumstances without logical reason

•  Litigation that is settled too easily or quickly with little or no involvement

of legal professional retained

•  Requests for payments to third parties without substantiating reason or

corresponding transaction

The issue of requiring attorneys to be gatekeepers in the AML/CFT area can
be controversial, given the fact that attorneys have confidential relationships

with their clients. Various alternatives have been discussed and debated,

including:

•  Deferring regulation until adequate education is conducted

•

Imposing internal controls and due diligence duties on lawyers regarding

unprivileged communications

•  Using a joint government-private sector body to regulate lawyers who

engage in financial activities, requiring registration with and regulation by

an agency

•  Devising a new hybrid approach, such as through guidance notes and best

practices standards from FATF

Gatekeeper issues in the United States are focused on the scope of the

requirements, particularly the definition of the financial transactions to which

reporting requirements apply. Many regulators within the United States want

the scope to coincide with the European Union Directive, which requires EU

members to ensure that obligations are imposed on a wide range of

professionals, including auditors, attorneys, tax advisors, real estate agents,

and notaries.

The extraterritorial reach of several existing US initiatives subject lawyers who

conduct international transactions to various requirements.

Gatekeepers (Case example: Role of
gatekeepers in facilitating money
laundering)

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

publication, Ending the Shell Game: Cracking Down on the Professionals Who

Enable Tax and White-Collar Crimes, highlights that, “White collar crimes like
tax evasion, bribery, and corruption are often concealed through complex

legal structures and financial transactions facilitated by lawyers, accountants,

financial institutions and other ‘professional enablers’ of such crimes.” The
report was issued to ensure that professional service providers are aware of

their responsibilities to identify, report, and avoid money laundering risks and

to provide strategies for countries to take action against criminals who abuse

their positions to conceal and facilitate illegal activity.

In January 2019, UK lawyer Ross McKay was sentenced to prison for seven

years, stripped of his license to practice, and required to pay £1,450 in costs

for helping organized criminals launder money via mortgage fraud.

McKay also suffered personal consequences. He damaged his reputation, lost

his livelihood, and left a wife and three young children with no financial support

for the time he was in prison.

The majority of professional service providers in gatekeeping positions, such

as lawyers, accountants, and financiers, play an important role in the financial

system and offer valuable legitimate services. However, because these

professionals provide a veneer of respectability and offer a level of knowledge

and skill that criminals might not possess, they are often engaged and

employed by criminals to facilitate their illegal activities. In fact, a criminal

organization’s business typically mirrors that found in a legitimate

environment. Some gatekeepers unwittingly assist in this illegal activity.

However, in some cases, they are complicit in facilitating and concealing their

clients’ criminal activities.

McKay was a “go-to,” or preferred, lawyer for criminals because he did not

conduct basic KYC checks, including understanding the nature of the client’s

business, inquiring about the source of funds, or understanding connections

between the parties and transactions.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 89

Version 6.44

McKay conducted more than 80 criminal transactions that helped a buy-to-

lease landlord use illicit money to fraudulently build a £10.8 million property
empire. McKay committed mortgage fraud by disguising the source of funds

for property deposits and used nominee names instead of the names of the
legitimate purchasers on mortgage applications. McKay also was the in-house

lawyer for a loan company that was a front to launder criminal proceeds. The

company belonged to a crime lord who was convicted of drug dealing.

McKay admitted that he knew the property transactions were being made to

launder money and that he was deliberately dishonest in facilitating them.

Key takeaways

•  Lawyers, accountants, financiers, and other "professional enablers” can

abuse their positions to facilitate financial crimes via seemingly legitimate

means.

•  Professional service providers need to be aware of their responsibilities to

identify, report, and avoid money laundering risks.

•  Professional service providers need to ensure that they understand all the
laws and regulations that apply to them, particularly when involved in

multijurisdictional business.

•  Professional enablers who commit crimes can be imprisoned and will likely

be unable to operate again within their chosen profession.

Role of Gatekeepers (Case example:
Special skills)

An attorney was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit money

laundering. The attorney had helped to invest his client’s drug proceeds by

forming a corporation in the name of the client’s wife and arranging a loan

from the corporation to another (noncriminal) client. He then drafted a fake

construction work contract, making the repayment of the loan appear to be

payment for construction work performed by the company. He also drew up a

promissory note, which the wife signed, but he did not provide copies of the

note to either party. The attorney also advised his client how to deposit the

cash from the loan without triggering reporting requirements.
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 90

Version 6.44

The appeals court upheld the attorney’s conviction but remanded him for

resentencing after finding that the district court abused its discretion by not
applying a sentencing enhancement based on the attorney’s use of special

skills (i.e., legal skills) in committing the offenses of conviction.

Key takeaways

•  Gatekeepers can help disguise the source of illicit funds so they appear to

originate from a legitimate business activity, such as a sale or loan.

•  Money laundering schemes facilitated by gatekeepers can involve multiple
parties, some of whom might not be aware of their own involvement.

•  The special skills of gatekeepers enable them to help their clients evade

detection using sophisticated money laundering schemes.

Investment and Commodity Advisors

Commodity futures and options accounts are vehicles that could be used to

launder illicit funds. What are they?

•  Commodities: Goods such as food, grains, and metals that are usually

traded in large amounts on a commodities exchange, typically through

futures contracts

•  Futures/futures contracts: Contracts to buy or sell a set quantity of a

commodity at a future date at a set price

•  Options/options contracts: Contracts that create the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell a set quantity of something, such as a share or

commodity, at a set price after a set expiration date

•  Commodity pool: A combination of funds from various investors to trade in

futures or options contracts

•  Omnibus accounts: Accounts held by one futures commission merchant

(FCM) for another, in which case transactions of multiple account holders

are combined, and their identities are unknown to the holding FCM

Commodity trading advisors (CTAs) engage in the business of advising others,

either directly or indirectly, regarding the value or advisability of trading

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 91

Version 6.44

futures contracts, commodity options, and swaps. They issue analyses and

other reports concerning trading futures and commodity options and are also
responsible for trading managed futures accounts. By directing such

accounts, CTAs are in a unique position to observe activity that might suggest
money laundering. As such, they need to be aware of what types of activities

indicate potential laundering and terrorist financing and should implement

compliance programs to detect and deter such activities.

Other professionals with similar responsibilities include:

•  Commodity pool operator: Operator or solicitor of funds for a commodity
pool, which combines funds from members and trades futures or options
contracts

•  Futures commission merchant (FCM): A firm or person that solicits or

accepts orders on futures contracts or commodity options and accepts

funds for their execution

•

Introducing broker-dealer in commodities (IB-C): A firm or person that
solicits and accepts orders for commodity futures from customers but

does not accept funds. IB-Cs can be guaranteed or independent:

o  Guaranteed introducing broker-dealer: An IB-C with an exclusive written
agreement with a futures commission merchant, which obligates the

FCM to assume responsibility for the IB-C’s performance

o

Independent introducing broker-dealer: An IB-C who is subject to
minimum capital and financial reporting requirements, and who may

introduce accounts to any FCM

•

Investment advisor: Provides advice on securities and investments and
manages client assets

The investment and commodity advising industry is susceptible to money
laundering in the following ways:

•  Withdrawal of assets through transfers to unrelated accounts or high-risk

jurisdictions

•  Frequent additions to or withdrawals from accounts

•  Clients invest via checks drawn on, or wire transfers from, accounts of third

parties with no relation to them

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 92

Version 6.44

•  Clients request custodial arrangements that allow them to remain

anonymous

•  Transfers of funds to the investment advisor, followed by transfers to

accounts at other institutions that suggest a layering scheme

•  CTAs or other professionals invest illegal proceeds for a client

•  Movement of funds to disguise their origin

Trust and Company Service Providers

Trust and company service providers (TCSPs) are gatekeepers who set up
trusts between parties and provide certain legal and administrative functions

for corporations. According to the FATF report Guidance for a Risk-Based

Approach for Trust and Company Service Providers, TCSPs include any

person or business that provides any of the following services to third parties:

•  Acting as an agent on behalf of legal persons to form a company

•  Acting as (or arranging for another person to act as) a director or secretary
of a company, a partner of a partnership, or a similar position in relation to

other legal persons

•  Providing a registered office, business address, or correspondence for a

company, partnership, or any other legal person or arrangement

•  Acting as (or arranging for another person to act as) a trustee of an

express trust

•  Acting as (or arranging for another person to act as) a nominee

shareholder for another person

The FATF report emphasizes the need for TCSPs to obtain detailed

information on customers and the need for them to understand the source of

funds and the general purpose of the structures they create for their clients’

benefit. In addition, TCSPs should always be able to identify the beneficial

owners and controlling persons for an account.

The FATF report also points out that some jurisdictions regulate TCSPs like

lawyers, meaning that clients can request confidentiality, thus putting TCSPs in

potential conflict with AML guidelines. Additionally, in some jurisdictions,
lawyers and other professionals fulfill the role that TCSPs play elsewhere, i.e.,

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 93

Version 6.44

creating and administering trusts and companies to manage client assets

(such as homes and cars) in jurisdictions other than those in which they live.

Although the vast majority of companies and trusts are used for legitimate

purposes, the types of legal relationships formed by TCSPs are commonly
used in money laundering schemes.

FATF’s report identifies the following vulnerabilities and red flags for the TCSP

industry:

•  Unknown or inconsistent application of regulatory guidelines regarding

identification and reporting requirements

•  Limited market restriction on practitioners to ensure adequate skills,

competence, and integrity

•

Inconsistent recordkeeping across the industry

•  Potential for TCSPs to operate in an unlicensed environment

•  Potential for a TCSP’s CDD to be performed by other financial
organizations, depending on the jurisdictional requirements

Potential indicators of money laundering in the TCSP industry include:

•  Transactions that require the use of complex and opaque legal entities and

arrangements

•  The payment of consultancy fees to shell companies established in other
jurisdictions or jurisdictions known to have a market in the formation of

numerous shell companies

•  The use of TCSPs in jurisdictions that do not require TCSPs to capture,

retain, or submit to competent authorities’ information on the beneficial

ownership of corporate structures formed by them

•  The use of legal persons and legal arrangements established in

jurisdictions with weak or absent AML/CFT laws and/or poor record of

supervision and monitoring of TCSPs

•  The use of legal persons or legal arrangements that operate in jurisdictions

with strict secrecy laws

•  Multiple intercompany loan transactions or multijurisdictional wire transfers

that have no apparent or legal purpose

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

According to Transparency International, a global coalition working to end the

injustice of corruption, it is important to focus on service providers, rather than
the company or trust, because the latter is merely the tool through which

money launderers operate. A company owned by criminals cannot protect
itself, but service providers can, through diligence, reduce the risk of abusing

the vehicles with which they have a relationship. For this reason, it is important

for countries to regulate service providers.

Regulations should stipulate how the service provider conducts its business,

including how directors selected by the provider meet their obligations as

trustees or trusteeships. Gibraltar was the first jurisdiction to bring these
activities under regulatory control by enacting legislation in 1989. Other

offshore jurisdictions either have introduced some form of regulatory control
or will in the future.

Regulations are not uniform; they range from a simple minimum capitalization

requirement to full regulatory oversight. Often, the scope of the legislation is

limited, excluding certain types of activities. Sometimes, the legislation bars

regulators from gaining access to client files without client permission or a

court order, thereby making checks on the adequacy of the license holder’s

CDD provisions extremely difficult. Furthermore, although some jurisdictions

include service providers within their AML regulations—for example, by making

compliance with the regulations a condition of licensing—many do not, leaving

service providers free of any AML duties beyond those imposed upon the

general public. According to Transparency International, because of these

differing standards, individuals seeking to use a company or trust for criminal

purposes can simply select a jurisdiction that lacks requirements or has only

inadequate ones.

Real Estate

The real estate sector is frequently used in money laundering activities.

Investing illicit capital in real estate is a classic method of laundering illicit

funds, particularly in countries with political, economic, and monetary stability.

Escrow accounts, generally maintained by real estate agents, brokers, and

other fiduciaries, are designed to hold funds entrusted to someone for

protection and proper disbursement. Countless real estate and business deals

are closed every day using escrow funds. They are attractive to
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 95

Version 6.44

money launderers because of the many diverse transactions that can pass

through them in any deal; escrow accounts can facilitate the movement of
funds by cashier’s checks, wire transfers, and company checks to seemingly

legitimate individuals and companies. Given the high levels of activity
expected in escrow accounts, money launderers can disguise illegal activity in

an account while appearing to operate it legally.

Although cash purchases of real estate are becoming more prevalent, many
transactions involve the deposit of a large check from the mortgagee, in

addition to checks and cash required from the buyer at closing. A money

laundering title insurance agent can make multiple deposits of cash on a given
day at several banks in amounts under the currency reporting threshold,

credited to different, nonexistent closings. The deposits appear to be typical
business activities, but they might represent the steady accumulation of funds

for the purchase of real property by a person wishing to hide the origin of

funds. Ultimately, monies could be paid outright by the escrow agent as

cashier’s checks obtained by the agent as wire transfers, or as corporate or

escrow checks to straw men or shell corporations.

Each closing also entails numerous routine disbursements for payment of the

proceeds to the seller, payoff of the mortgage, real estate commissions,

taxes, satisfaction of liens, and other payments. To a bank and other

observers, the disbursement of funds at a closing might appear to be one

legitimate set of transactions. Money laundering can be easily hidden because

the size and volume of routine escrow account activity smooths out the

“spikes” (i.e., the ups and downs in an account) and multiple deposits

associated with money laundering.

The reverse situation can also occur in the real estate industry. A money

launderer might find a cooperative property seller who agrees to a reported

purchase price well below the actual value of the property and then accepts

the difference in unreported cash. For example, a money launderer could

purchase a $2 million property for $1 million and secretly give the balance to

the cooperative seller. After holding the property for a time, the launderer
could sell it for its true value of $2 million.

In the loan-back money laundering method, a criminal provides an associate

with a specific amount of illegitimate money. The associate then provides a

loan or mortgage back to the trafficker for the same amount, with all the

necessary loan or mortgage documentation. This creates the appearance

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 96

Version 6.44

that the trafficker’s funds are legitimate. The scheme is reinforced through

legitimately scheduled payments made on the loan by the traffickers.

FinCEN published Suspected Money Laundering in the Real Estate Industry, an

assessment based on analysis of SAR filings. The report makes a distinction
between fraudsters and money launderers. Lenders are likely to file a SAR

when they are the target of failed or successful mortgage fraud schemes that

threaten their organization’s revenues. However, it can be extremely difficult
to detect mortgage loan fraud perpetrated by money launderers, because

money launderers project the image of legitimacy by integrating illicit funds

through regular and timely payments. For example, only approximately 20
percent of SAR filings associated with the residential real estate industry

reportedly described suspected structuring and/or money laundering.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) identified

real estate as a significant money laundering channel in Australia.

According to the brief, real estate is an attractive channel for laundering illicit

funds because:

•

It can be purchased with cash.

•  The ultimate beneficial ownership can be disguised.

•

It is a relatively stable and reliable investment.

•  Value can be increased through renovations and improvements.

Money laundering through real estate can be relatively uncomplicated

compared with other methods and requires little planning or expertise. Large

sums of criminal proceeds can be integrated into the legitimate economy

through real estate investments in the placement and layering phases.

Properties can also be sold for a profit or retained for residential, investment,

or vacation purposes in the integration phase.

In Australia, common money laundering methods involving real estate include:

•  Using third-party straw buyers described as "cleanskins"

•  Using loans and mortgages as a cover for laundering, which might involve
lump sum cash repayments to integrate illicit funds into the economy

•  Manipulating property values to disguise undisclosed cash payments

through overvaluing, undervaluing, or flipping through successive sales to

increase value

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

•  Structuring cash deposits used for the purchase

•  Generating rental income to legitimize illicit funds

•  Conducting criminal activity, such as the production of cannabis or

synthetic drugs, at the purchased property

•  Using illicit cash to make property improvements to increase the value and

profits at sale

•  Using front companies, shell companies, trusts, and other company

structures to hide beneficial ownership and obvious links to criminals

•  Using gatekeepers, such as real estate agents, conveyancers, and
solicitors, to conceal criminal involvement, complicate the money

laundering process, and provide a veneer of legitimacy to the transaction

Investing by overseas-based criminals to conceal assets and avoid

confiscation from authorities in their home jurisdiction

The report cites methods for detecting money laundering through real estate

when transactions intersect with the regulated AML/CFT sector, such as when

transactions involve financial organizations in the form of loans, deposits, and

withdrawals. It also outlines red flags that should prompt further monitoring

and examination, particularly when multiple indicators are present.

These red flags include:

•  Various uses of cash to aggregate funds for property purchase, down

payment, and loan repayment

•  Multiple purchases and sales in a short period of time, possibly involving

property overvaluation, undervaluation, or straw buyers

•  Use of offshore lenders

•  Unknown sources of funds for purchase, such as incoming foreign wires in

which the originator and beneficiary customer are the same

•  Ownership being the customer’s only link to the country in which the real

estate is being purchased

In its five-part Towers of Secrecy series published in 2015, The New York Times

pierced the secrecy of more than 200 shell companies that have owned

condominiums at the Time Warner Center, a high-end property located in the
heart of Manhattan. In the investigative series, the newspaper found that

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 98

Version 6.44

nearly one-half of the most expensive residential properties are purchased

through shell companies throughout the United States. At the Time Warner
Center, non-Americans own 37 percent of the condos, at least 16 of whom

have been the subject of governmental inquiries, including for housing and
environmental fraud. These owners have included government officials and

close associates of officials from Russia, Colombia, Malaysia, China,

Kazakhstan, and Mexico. They primarily used limited liability companies for the
purchases. Often, signatures on the property documents were illegible, blank,

or signed by a lawyer with the lawyer’s contact information registered.

The paper states that there are no legal requirements for the real estate
industry in the United States to identify beneficial owners or examine their

backgrounds. In 2016 (subsequent to The New York Times series), FinCEN
began issuing a series of geographic targeting orders (GTOs) to help law

enforcement identify individuals acquiring luxury residential properties

through limited liability companies and other opaque structures without the

use of bank financing. During the 180 days of each outstanding GTO, US title

insurance companies are required to identify the natural people behind shell

companies used to pay all cash for high-end residential real estate in specified

US metropolitan areas that exceed specified dollar amounts prescribed for

each area. It is important to note that, in this context, “all cash” refers to

transactions that do not involve traditional financing; it does not necessarily

refer to the use of physical cash.

International Trade Activity

International trade activity is critical to an integrated economy and involves
numerous components that can be manipulated for the benefit of money

launderers and terrorist financiers. These components include banks,

currency exchanges, free trade zones, cross-border payments, ports,
invoices, goods, shipments, shell companies, and credit instruments that are

often inherently complex transactions. Trade-based money laundering and
the Black-Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) are two significant money

laundering techniques that have proven successful in illicit finance. Typically,

free trade zones are manipulated in both techniques.

Free Trade Zones

Free trade zones (FTZs) play an integral role in international trade. FTZs are

designated geographic areas with special regulatory and tax treatments for

certain trade-related goods and services. FTZs are often located in

developing countries near ports of entry, but they are separate from

traditional ports of entry and typically operate under different rules. Most

major FTZs are also located in regional financial centers that link international

trade hubs with access to global financial markets. Examples of FTZs are the

Colón Free Trade Zone in Panama and the Shanghai Free Trade Zone
(officially the China Pilot Free Trade Zone) in China.

According to FATF, systemic weaknesses for FTZs include:

•

Inadequate AML/CFT safeguards

•  Minimal oversight by local authorities

•  Weak procedures to inspect goods and legal entities, including inadequate

recordkeeping and information technology systems

•  Lack of cooperation between FTZs and local customs authorities

The relaxed oversight in FTZs makes it more challenging to detect illicit activity
and provides an opportune setting for trade-based money laundering

schemes. Moreover, FATF noted that some FTZs are as large as cities, which

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 100

Version 6.44

makes it difficult to effectively monitor incoming and outgoing cargo, as well

as repackaging and relabeling. Some FTZs export billions of dollars annually
but have few competent authorities available to monitor and examine cargo

and trade transactions.

Trade-Based Money Laundering

When men’s briefs and women’s underwear enter a country at prices of $739
per dozen, missile and rocket launchers export for only $52 each, and full

toilets ship out for less than $2 each, one should notice the red flags. These
manipulated trade prices represent potential money laundering, tax evasion,

and terrorist financing.

FATF defines trade-based money laundering (TBML) as the process of

disguising the proceeds of crime and moving value by using trade

transactions to legitimize their illicit origins. In practice, this can be achieved

through the misrepresentation of the price, quantity, or quality of imports and

exports. Moreover, TBML techniques vary in complexity and are frequently

used in combination with other money laundering techniques to further
obscure the money trail.

Money launderers can move money out of one country by using their illicit

funds to purchase high-value products and then exporting them at low prices

to a colluding foreign partner, who then sells them in the open market at their

true value. To give the transactions the appearance of legitimacy, the partners

may use a financial organization for trade financing, which often entails letters
of credit and other documentation.

TBML represents an important channel of criminal activity and, given the

growth of world trade, it is an increasingly important money laundering and

terrorist financing vulnerability. Moreover, as the standards applied to other

money laundering techniques become increasingly effective, the use of TBML
can be expected to become increasingly attractive.

According to the Guidance Paper on Combating Trade-based Money

Laundering, developed by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, understanding
the commercial purpose of any trade transaction is a key requirement in

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 101

Version 6.44

determining its money laundering risk. The guidance refers to six ways to

execute TBML:

1.  Overinvoicing and underinvoicing:

•  Overinvoicing: This technique involves invoicing the goods or services at

a price above the fair market price, so the seller (i.e., exporter) can

receive value from the buyer (i.e., importer). In this scenario, the

payment for the goods or services is higher than the value that the
buyer receives when it is sold on the open market.

•  Underinvoicing: This technique involves invoicing the goods or services
at a price below the fair market price. The seller can transfer value to
the buyer, because the payment for the goods or services is lower than

the value the buyer receives when the goods are sold on the open

market.

2.  Overshipping or short-shipping: There is a difference between the invoiced
quantity of goods and the quantity of goods that are shipped, whereby the

buyer or seller gains excess value based on the payment made.

3.  Ghost-shipping: In fictitious trades, a buyer and seller collude to create
documentation indicating that goods were sold and shipped, and

payments were made, but no goods were actually shipped.

4.  Shell companies: These companies are used to reduce the transparency of

ownership in the transaction.

5.  Multiple invoicing: Numerous invoices are issued for the same shipment of
goods, thus allowing the money launderer to make numerous payments

and justify them with the invoices.

6.  Black market trades: In the BMPE, a domestic transfer of funds is used to

pay for goods by a foreign importer.

Letters of credit are another vehicle for money laundering. Letters of credit

are a credit instrument issued by a bank that guarantees payments on behalf

of its customer to a third party when certain conditions are met. Letters of

credit are commonly used to finance exports because exporters want

assurance that the ultimate buyer of its goods will make payment, and this is

given by the buyer’s purchase of a bank letter of credit. The letter of credit is

then forwarded to a correspondent bank in the jurisdiction in which the

payment is to be made. The letter of credit is drawn on when the goods are

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 102

Version 6.44

loaded for shipping, received at the importation point, clear customs, and are

delivered. Letters of credit can be used to facilitate money laundering by
transferring money from a country with lax exchange controls, thus creating

the appearance that an import transaction is involved. Moreover, letters of
credit can also serve as a façade when laundering money through the

manipulation of import and export prices. Another method of illegally using

letters of credit is in conjunction with wire transfers to bolster the legitimate
appearance of nonexistent trade transactions.

The Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) cited the lack of reliable

statistics relating to TBML as a major obstacle in devising strategies to tackle it.
To assist in recognizing the multiple forms of TBML, the group enumerates

specific characteristics and red flags associated with jurisdictions, goods,
corporate structures, and predicate offenses.

It concluded that any strategy to prevent and combat TBML needs to be

based on dismantling TBML structures, while allowing genuine trade to occur

unfettered. It calls for an integrated, holistic approach, with an emphasis on

interagency coordination and international cooperation to standardize data

and statistics, create domestic task forces, deliver TBML-focused training, and
conduct further research.

FinCEN issued an advisory on the use of funnel accounts and TBML. The

advisory was the result of the possible impact of the 2010 Mexican law that

restricted cash deposits of US dollars in Mexican banks. Subsequently, the

restrictions were expanded to include similar deposits made at exchange

houses (casas de cambio) and brokerages (casas de bolsa) in Mexico.

Furthermore, additional guidance was issued by FinCEN based on bulk cash

smuggling trends related to the restrictions, which indicated an increase in

the use of funnel accounts to move illicit proceeds of Mexico-related criminal

organizations.

FinCEN defines a funnel account as “an individual or business account in one

geographic area that receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below

the cash reporting threshold, and from which the funds are withdrawn in a

different geographic area with little time elapsing between the deposits and

withdrawals.”

Red flags of possible funnel account activity include:

•  An account opened in one US state receives numerous cash deposits of

less than $10,000 (the currency reporting requirement) by

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 103

Version 6.44

unidentified persons at branches outside the geographic region in which

the account is held.

•  Business account deposits take place in a different geographic region

from where the business operates.

•

Individuals opening or making deposits to funnel accounts lack information

about the stated activity of the account, the account owner, or the source

of the cash.

•  A business account receives out-of-state deposits with debits that do not

appear to be related to its business purpose.

•  There are notable differences between the handwriting on the payee,
amount, and signature lines on checks issued from an account that

receives out-of-state cash deposits.

•  Wire transfers or checks issued from a funnel account are deposited into,
or cleared through, the US correspondent account of a Mexican bank.

Trade-based money laundering (Case
example: Methods of money laundering)

The scheme began with the purchase of luxury vehicles in Germany by legal

entities established and owned by the criminals, using cash generated by illicit

sources. Most of the companies were shell companies with the sole purpose

of supporting the scheme. Using these legal entities, the criminals created a

fake paper trail for sales and purchases, including value-added tax (VAT)

chains. Next, they used TBML activities to move and disguise the proceeds of

crime. They also generated additional criminal proceeds by committing tax

fraud by importing goods VAT-free. The criminals also convinced a legitimate

supplier in Italy to annually deliver high numbers of vehicles, increasing the

legitimacy of their activities.

In addition, import and export companies owned by the OCG were used to

purchase other items, ranging from luxury watches to clothing and footwear.

The watches were purchased in European countries before being supplied to

drug traffickers in Morocco and the Netherlands. The lower value goods

purchased in Hong Kong and mainland China were exported to Colombia and
Morocco for onward sale.

The criminals used the TBML scheme for laundering criminal proceeds and

generating additional proceeds of crime. The activity spanned several

jurisdictions, making it difficult for authorities to identify and understand the

magnitude of the scheme.

Key takeaways

•  Criminals use international trade to disguise illegal activities.

•  Shell companies and fake invoicing are common techniques.

•  Joint investigations mitigate cross-border and jurisdictional challenges.

•  Criminals add complexity to cross border trade by commingling with

legitimate activity.

Black Market Peso Exchange

A form of TBML, the BMPE is a process by which money in the United States

derived from illegal activity is purchased by Colombian peso brokers and
deposited in US bank accounts established by the brokers. The brokers sell

checks and wire transfers drawn on those accounts to legitimate businesses,

which use them to purchase goods and services in the United States.
Although the United States is prominently figured in BMPE, the process is not

limited exclusively to that country.

Colombian importers created the BMPE in the 1950s as a mechanism for

buying US dollars on the black market to avoid domestic taxes and duties on

the official purchase of US dollars and imported goods purchased with dollars.

In the 1970s, Colombian drug cartels began using the BMPE to convert drug

dollars earned in the United States to pesos in Colombia. Why? It reduced their

risk of losing their money through seizures, and they received their money
faster, even though they paid a premium to the peso broker.

FinCEN reported that black market currency exchange systems have evolved

beyond the Colombian BMPE method, mainly because of increased diligence

by US banks. A common method used for the initial placement of illicit funds

into the financial system is structured deposits in the form of cash, money

orders, and other financial instruments. However, money launderers are using

individuals and businesses that have control over numerous bank accounts at

numerous banks to smuggle cash in bulk from the United States. The

smuggled US dollars are deposited into foreign institutions—often in Mexico,

but also in Central and South American countries—and wired back to the

United States and other prominent trade countries as payments for

international trade goods and services.

Version 6.44

Black market peso exchange example

According to the US Department of Justice the following is a typical BMPE
scenario involving the United States and Mexico:

   A peso broker works with an individual engaged in illegal activity, such as a
drug trafficker, who has US currency in the United States that he needs to

bring to Mexico and convert to pesos. The peso broker finds business

owners in Mexico who buy goods from vendors in the United States, such

as XYZ Inc., and need dollars to pay for those goods. The peso broker
arranges for the illegally obtained dollars in the United States to be

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 107

Version 6.44

delivered to the US-based vendors, such as XYZ Inc., where they are used

to pay for the goods purchased by the Mexico-based customers. Once the
goods are shipped to Mexico and sold by the Mexico-based business

owner for pesos, the pesos are turned over to the peso broker, who then
pays the drug trafficker in Mexico.

Links of TMBL and BMPE schemes (Case
example: Methods of money laundering)

In February 2021, the operator of an international wholesale consumer

electronics business based in the US pled guilty to participating in a conspiracy

to operate an unlicensed money services business (MSB). The MSB operated

primarily between Colombia and the US and was used to legitimize money

transfers. A US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigation led to

the arrests of the company CEO and six Columbian nationals, who were

arrested in Columbia. As of this writing, the US government is seeking the

extradition of these Columbian individuals.

The DEA found that the network ran operations in the US and Columbia that

enabled drug traffickers to move funds into the banking system. They then

laundered the funds and moved them across the border, using a black-

market peso exchange (BMPE) scheme. Among the charges was operating

an MSB without a license.

The BMPE and similarly structured schemes are sophisticated methods of

trade-based money laundering. Cash-intensive businesses and cross-border

activities are high risk for being used to facilitate this crime.

In January 2020, an investigation by the Offices of the United States Attorneys

and the DEA discovered that drug dealers in the US were connected to

Columbian drug cartels. These dealers generated US dollars by selling

Columbian drugs in the US. The cartels needed to move their funds out of the

US, without physically transporting USD across international borders or directly

depositing large amounts of cash into the financial systems. They used the

BPME scheme to clean the illegal funds.

Money brokers are essentially unlicensed MSBs. Operating primarily in

Colombia, they were used to receive US dollars in the US via couriers or

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 108

Version 6.44

receipt of wires. They then paid out in Columbian pesos in Columbia for a

commission.

The US based Agarwal Electronics Business exported consumer electronics

globally, including to Columbia. Its CEO knowingly participated in the scheme
and worked with the money broker by offering use of his bank account to

receive the funds in the US. This account was then used to transfer the

proceeds of drug sales to accounts in Middle and South America. Upon
receiving the funds into his bank account, the CEO arranged for the export of

the roughly equivalent value of electronics products to certain Colombian

suppliers. They in turn arranged to pay for the products by delivering pesos to
an individual in Colombia. This individual then delivered the funds to the money

broker. This scheme enabled the funds to be remitted to Colombia without
the need to report, declare, or smuggle them over the US border.

Key takeaways

•  The BMPE scheme enabled the cartels to place the money into the

banking system and move it across borders.

•  A TBML scheme was used to pay the money brokers in Columbian pesos.

•  Cash intensive business and cross border activity are at higher risk of being

used to facilitate money laundering.

Complex TBML/BMPE schemes (Case
example: Methods of money laundering)

In April 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO that lowered cash-reporting thresholds and

implemented additional recordkeeping requirements for certain financial

transactions for approximately 700 Miami-based electronics exporters.

According to FinCEN, the GTO was designed to disrupt complex BMPE-

related schemes employed by drug-trafficking organizations, (DTOs),

including the Sinaloa and Los Zetas DTOs based in Mexico.

Law enforcement investigations revealed that many of these businesses are

exploited by sophisticated TBML/BMPE schemes in which drug proceeds in

the United States are converted into goods that are shipped to South

America, sold for local currency, and ultimately transferred to
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 109

Version 6.44

drug cartels. The GTO was designed to enhance the transparency of the

covered businesses’ transactions.

Key takeaways

•  DTOs take advantage of complex BMPE schemes involving the export of

goods across the US/Mexico border to help move funds from the US back

to the country where the DTO is based.

•  Lower cash-reporting requirements can help enforcement agencies
detect BMPE schemes and alert regulated organizations to potentially

suspicious activity.

•  Robust recordkeeping can help to detecting BMPE schemes, so that

enforcement officers can access a regulated organization’s transaction

records.

Wildlife Trafficking

Wildlife trafficking is defined as the illegal trade, smuggling, poaching, capture,

and collection of endangered species and protected wildlife. It also includes

wildlife derivatives and byproducts, such as leather, food, medicines, and

exotic pets. The illegal wildlife trade threatens the extinction of several animal

and plant species. It is a practice that affects more than 7,000 species

worldwide to satisfy the illegal market demands for endangered wildlife and
its byproducts.

The three stages of wildlife trafficking include:

1.  Source: The first stage involves the location where the initial trafficking
activities occur, such as the jurisdiction in which poaching and initial

transport takes place. Wildlife trafficking crimes are often facilitated by

bribing corrupt officials and individuals with access to the targeted species.

At the source location, the profits generated are often the lowest.

Furthermore, source countries are potentially the most significantly

affected by the illegal wildlife trade from the biodiversity and economic

standpoints.

2.  Transit: The second stage involves the movement of poached or illegally
obtained wildlife goods that are disguised and consolidated with other

items for transportation. These concealed items can clear customs

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 110

Version 6.44

because of known weaknesses in customs controls and/or bribery of

corrupt officials.

3.  Destination: The final stage involves poached, illegally acquired or trafficked
goods arriving at their final destination for sale. Because the sale of these
products is illegal in some countries, they are often sold at in-person or

online black markets, where profits for distributors are often the highest.

Organizations can combat wildlife trafficking by:

•  Joining the United for Wildlife Financial Taskforce and signing the

Mansion House Declaration

•  Using current suspicious activity reporting mechanisms to report

potential wildlife trafficking

•  Reviewing United for Wildlife Financial Taskforce intelligence alerts and
implementing policies and procedures to support the detection and

reporting of wildlife trafficking

•  Reviewing FATF’s Money Laundering and the Illegal Wildlife Trade report

for valuable insights and red flags

Risk Associated with New

Payment Products and Services

The internet, new payment platforms, and electronic money (e-money) have

changed the way people conduct business and transact with one another, as

well as how consumers buy products and services. Small corner shops that
were limited to servicing local consumers can now have a broader, global

reach with an online business as well. Digital payment platforms have altered
how consumers and the regulatory environment view merchants and funds

transmission. The lower cost of technology; globally interdependent society;

increasingly highly skilled, engineering-based workforce; and entrepreneurial

drive have all contributed to the evolution of new payment products and

services that expand the boundaries of how and where money is used.

Generally, the risk posed by these new payment systems is relative to the

functionality of the services and their funding mechanisms.

Prepaid Cards, Mobile Payments, and
Internet-Based Payment Services

Alternative payment methods, including prepaid cards, digital wallets, and e-

money continue to rise in popularity in the increasingly digital, fast-moving

world. In October 2006, FATF first published a report that examined the ways

in which money can be laundered through the exploitation of new payment

methods, such as prepaid cards, internet payment systems, mobile payments,

and digital precious metals. The report found that, although there is a

legitimate market demand for these payment methods, money laundering

and terrorist financing vulnerabilities exist. In addition, cross-border providers

of new payment methods can pose more risk than providers strictly operating

within a specific country. The report recommended continued vigilance to

further assess the effect of evolving technologies on cross-border and

domestic regulatory frameworks. Since 2006, FATF has

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 112

Version 6.44

published additional guidance on new payment methods, typologies, and the

risk-based approach.

Prepaid cards

Prepaid cards have the same characteristics that make cash attractive to
criminals: They are portable, valuable, exchangeable, and anonymous.

Typically, prepaid products require the consumer to pay in advance for future
purchases of goods and services. Each payment is subtracted from the

balance of the card or product until the total amount is spent.

Prepaid cards can be categorized as either open loop or closed loop. Open-
loop prepaid cards, many of which are network branded by American

Express, Visa, or MasterCard, can be purchased and loaded with money by

one person and used like regular debit cards by the same person or another

person to make purchases or ATM withdrawals anywhere in the world.

Closed-loop prepaid products are of limited use for a specific purpose or

service, such as with a certain merchant or retailer, whether online or at a

physical location. A prepaid card can be either nonreloadable, which means it

is purchased for a fixed amount that cannot be reloaded as the funds are

depleted, or reloadable, which permits adding funds on the card to replace

what was previously spent.

Although there are many different types of prepaid cards that are used in a

variety of ways, the cards typically operate in the same way as a debit card

and ultimately rely on access to an account. There might be an account for

each card that is issued or, alternatively, a pooled account that holds the

prepaid funds for all cards issued. The cards can be issued by, and accounts

can be held at, a depository institution or a nonbank organization; pooled
accounts are normally held by the issuer at a bank.

According to the FATF reports on this topic, the potential risk factors

commonly associated with prepaid cards are:

•  Anonymous cardholders

•  Anonymous funding

•  Anonymous access to funds

•  High value limits and no limits on the number of cards individuals can

acquire

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 113

Version 6.44

•  Global access to cash through ATMs

•  Offshore card issuers that might not observe laws in all jurisdictions

•  Use as substitute for bulk-cash smuggling

Following multiple high-profile money laundering and terrorist financing cases

involving prepaid cards, including the 2015 Paris attacks, the European Union

took steps to reduce the limits on prepaid cards under the Fourth Anti-Money
Laundering Directive, which went into effect in 2017, and again in the Fifth

Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which went into effect in 2020. According to

the Fifth Directive, the monthly transaction limit and maximum amount that
can be stored on prepaid cards not subject to due diligence is €150. Online

transactions associated with such cards have similarly been limited to €50.

Restrictions have also been placed on the use of prepaid cards that originate

from outside of the European Union. The combined deployment of limits and

geographic restrictions have helped to mitigate some of the greatest risk
factors commonly associated with prepaid cards.

Electronic money

According to the JMLSG’s sectoral guidance on preventing money laundering

and combating terrorist financing, e-money is “a prepaid means of payment

that can be used to make payments to multiple persons, where the persons

are distinct legal or natural entities.” E-money products can be card-based,

app-based, or online account-based. They can be issued by financial

organizations, building societies, and specialist e-money institutions. Examples

of e-money include prepaid cards that can be used to pay for goods at a

range of retailers and virtual purses that can be used to pay for goods and

services online. All UK e-money institutions are regulated by the FCA and

governed under the Electronic Money Regulations (2011), which require

compliance with all AML/CFT and sanctions requirements. In the UK, this

means all e-money institutions are subject to the Money Laundering

Regulations 2017.

The guidance identifies several risk factors inherent in e-money for money

laundering and terrorist financing, including:

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 114

Version 6.44

•  High transaction or purse limits

•  The ability of a customer to hold numerous purses or cards

•  E-money issuers using complex business models (e.g., “white-label”

products and outsourcing, particularly to overseas jurisdictions), resulting in
a complex AML/CFT control environment

•  Certain merchant activity with high-risk businesses, such as gambling,

which allows for the movement of higher amounts of funds

•  Funding with unverified persons, whether customers or third parties

•  Funding with cash that leaves no electronic trail to the source of funds, as

well as the ability for cash withdrawal

•  Funding with other e-money that lacks verified persons and/or source of

funds

•  Non-face-to-face transactional activity

•  Features that increase the functionality of the card in terms of how to
execute transactions, such as person-to-person, business-to-person,

business-to-business, and person-to-business transactions

The guidance lists specific controls that e-money institutions should consider

implementing in order to effectively mitigate the above risks, in addition to
meeting standard AML/CFT obligations, including:

•  Conducting robust oversight of outsourced functions

•  Placing limits on storage values, transactions, and turnover

•

•

Implementing transaction monitoring systems that are able to detect

money laundering patterns and deviations from normal transaction

patterns

Implementing systems to detect individuals holding multiple

purses, accounts, and cards, including across multiple e-money issuers

•  Utilizing geolocation, device-related information, and IP addresses to

identify discrepancies in customer activity from the information provided

at onboarding (e.g., an individual onboarding in the United Kingdom, but

only transacting from their device in Russia)

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 115

Version 6.44

•  Cooperating with merchants that accept e-money to better detect

suspicious activity

•

Instituting geographic restrictions on the use and function of e-money

products, such as limiting use to the UK, EU, or other comparable
jurisdictions with strong AML/CFT supervision

CDD is another important control that can help mitigate the risks associated

with e-money. As noted above, there are some limits under which CDD is not
required for prepaid card and e-money products. Outside of this, standard

due diligence measures typically apply to e-money, although there are some

circumstances in which simplified due diligence may be applied when the
situation is sufficiently low-risk. When an e-money organization applies

simplified due diligence, additional checks should still be considered to help

mitigate fraud risk by establishing who controls a funding instrument. For

example, some e-money issuers use a “micro-deposit,” or a small charge on a

customer’s funding account, to help confirm the customer has access to the
funding account and is not defrauding another individual.

E-money organizations are often just one party in a larger, more complex

scheme that includes other banks, merchants, payment schemes, and

payment processors. In these set-ups, e-money issuers must be satisfied that

the due diligence measures being performed on the involved merchants align
with sectoral guidance.

One concern with e-money is that it is offered predominantly in a non-face-

to-face context. However, as noted in the FATF guidance paper Digital
Identity, non-face-to-face onboarding can be just as robust, if not more so, as

face-to-face onboarding when the appropriate systems and controls are in

place to verify identities using reliable, independent sources.

The risks of payment services and e-money are also assessed by the United

Kingdom’s National Risk Assessment. In 2017 and 2020, the money laundering

and terrorist financing risk level associated with payment services and e-

money was “medium.” The assessment noted certain typologies associated

with e-money, such as the movement of illicit funds in and out of Eastern

Europe, although it also noted the development of new controls. For example,

“Strong Customer Authentication” adds extra layers of security checks to

electronic payments to reduce the risk of fraud. The assessment concluded

that the sector would continue to be monitored closely, given its novelty and

likelihood to evolve.

Virtual Currency

Virtual currency (VC) is a medium of exchange, unit of account, and/or a store

of value that operates in the digital space without legal tender status. VCs are
distinguished from “fiat currency,” or “real currency,” which refers to

government-issued currency that is typically accepted as the medium of

exchange. Although a simplification, VCs often fall into two categories:
centralized and decentralized. Centralized VCs have a centralized repository

and a single administrator. They can be issued by a central government (e.g.,
the Bahamian Sand Dollar, the first fully launched central bank digital currency)

or a non-government administrator (e.g., Facebook’s Diem). Decentralized

VCs (e.g., Bitcoin) have no repositories or administrators, but they work as a
peer-to-peer media of exchange without the need for an intermediary.

According to FATF, VCs can also be distinguished between convertible VCs

(e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple), which have an equivalent value and can

be exchanged in real currency, and non-convertible VCs (e.g., Reddit

Coins and World of Warcraft Gold), which are intended to be specific to a
particular domain.

VCs allow value to be transmitted anywhere in the world without the

requirement of a centralized bank or institutional authority. In 2009, the Bitcoin

ecosystem was developed as a cryptographic protocol to transfer value

through a peer-to-peer network without reliance on a centralized banking

structure. Since then, other coins, such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin,

have become popular, and new coins are regularly being developed.

Coins are units of value transfer that are established as a virtual currency.

Much like any financial instrument, a coin derives its value from what another

party is willing to trade for that item. For most coins, there is a value that is

expressed in fiat currency that is based upon economic and market

forces. Coins can be expressed as an equivalent value in each locale’s specific

currency.

One of the most significant concerns with regard to VCs and financial crime is

the potential for anonymity. Some coins, such as Bitcoin, can be tracked

through a public ledger. However, depending on the regulatory status of the

exchanges and wallet providers involved, it can be difficult to identify who is

behind a specific wallet address, where the funds originated, and the

destination of the funds in the “fiat” space. Additionally, some coins, such as

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 117

Version 6.44

Monero, ensure all users are anonymous, making it very difficult to trace

funds.

FinCEN was one of the first FIUs to offer interpretative guidance on VCs and to

clarify their regulatory status. FinCEN categorized participants in the
ecosystem into three segments:

•  A User is a person who obtains VC to purchase goods or services.

•  An Exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of VC for

real currency, funds, or other virtual currency.

•  An Administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing VC and who

has the authority to redeem such virtual currency.

The guidance states that Administrators or Exchangers of VC are, unless

exempted, MSBs engaging in money transmission. As such, they must comply

with the registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and other regulations

applicable to money transmitters, such as maintaining a compliant AML

program.

In a typical transaction scenario, a User has an established virtual wallet or an

account with an Exchanger to conduct a transaction. The User acquires VC

from the Exchanger, which allows the User to transfer funds in and out of that
account.

FinCEN consolidated and clarified its position by providing guidance for

certain business models that involve convertible VCs. This guidance expanded

how regulations would apply in different scenarios, including those involving

different types of VC wallet providers, VC kiosks (often called “Crypto ATMs”),

and decentralized (distribution) applications (“DApps”). DApps are software

programs using distributed ledger technology that are not controlled by a

single, identifiable administrator.

At a global level, FATF amended its Recommendations to explicitly require

virtual asset service providers (VASPs)—providers of VCs—to be regulated for

AML/CFT purpose as part of Recommendation 15. An interpretative note

adopted on Recommendation 15 clarified how to consider other FATF

Recommendations in the context of VCs and VASPs, including the application

of a risk-based approach, supervision, and monitoring to VASPs, the

implementation of AML/CFT controls within VASPs, and international

cooperation on VC and VASP-related activity. This included expanding
Recommendation 16 regarding the exchange of identifying
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 118

Version 6.44

information between originators and beneficiaries, to cover VC transactions.

This is commonly referred to as the “travel rule.”

FATF has since undertaken multiple reviews to assess the implementation of

the revised FATF Recommendations. The Second 12-Month Review of the
Revised FATF Standards, released in July 2021, noted that significant progress

had been made globally in implementing the revised Recommendations, but

that more work was still needed. Of 128 jurisdictions assessed in 2021, 70 (55%)
had yet to implement the revised Recommendations into national law.

Implementation of the travel rule was highlighted as being particularly difficult

due to the absence of proper investment in the necessary technological
solutions to facilitate full global compliance.

FATF published a list of red flag indicators to assist regulated organizations in

identifying suspicious activity involving VCs. The report noted that the most

common misuse of VCs was connected to sales of illicit substances,

particularly through activity on the “dark web.” The second most common

misuse was related to fraud, scams, ransomware, and extortion. The use of

VCs to help layer and disguise the true origin of proceeds from professional

money laundering networks is also becoming more common.

FATF updated its guidance for organizations working to design a risk-based

approach to the treatment of VCs and VASPs that discourages blanket “de-

risking” of virtual asset-related activity. The guidance provides additional risk

indicators to consider in a VC context, particularly concerning the risks of

peer-to-peer VC exchanges, as well as more information on the

implementation of the FATF Recommendations, including the travel rule. The

guidance also addresses how FATF standards apply to VCs tied to a specific

fiat currency or commodity, otherwise known as stable coins. This followed an

FATF Report to the Group of Twenty (G20) on the same subject. The

guidance also clarifies when FATF standards might need to be applied to
“decentralized finance,” or “DeFi,” products and services.

Use of virtual currency (Case example:
Methods of money laundering)

In the early days of cryptocurrency exchanges, criminals operated in what

was described as the “weak spot” of financial services. Criminal exchanges

and operators were able to conduct a wide range of criminal activity, often
with little enforcement action, due to limited primary and secondary

legislation and regulation. Law enforcement also had limited capability to
investigate and prosecute offenders.

In 2017, a ground-breaking US-led investigation into criminal users of BTC-e, a

cryptocurrency trading platform, discovered that users were allowed to:

•  Operate with high levels of anonymity, as user identification and

verification details were not consistently required

•  Obscure and anonymize transactions

•  Openly discuss criminality on the BTC-e user chat

•  Obtain advice from BTC-e on how to access illegally obtained money from

drug sales

In December 2020, Paris courts sentenced Alexander Vinnik, founder of BTC-

e, to five years in prison on money laundering charges.

Currently there exists a much wider understanding of the high risks presented

by the use of cryptocurrency. This understanding has resulted in an array of

global, cross-sector cooperation and regulation to prevent and prosecute the
misuse of cryptocurrencies.

BTC-e was one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges and one of the world’s

largest and most widely used digital currency exchanges.

In 2017 US authorities seized BTC-e, along with 38% of the users’ funds. Vinnik

fled to Greece, where the authorities arrested him following US indictments
for laundering US$4 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC).

Vinnik was linked to corrupt politicians, ransomware scams, identity theft

schemes, and narcotics distribution rings. Greek authorities eventually

extradited Vinnik to France in January 2020. Vinnik was found guilty by French

authorities of money laundering as part of an organized crime group and
sentence to 5 years in prison.

Version 6.44

The activities in cryptocurrency laundering are often similar to those found in

mainstream financial services. One difference is that the ultimate
beneficiaries of cryptocurrency laundering need to convert their criminal

cryptocurrency funds into criminal fiat funds to make them more widely
usable, as part of the integration phase of money laundering.

Cryptocurrency laundering has prompted global regulators to ensure that

local AML/CFT laws are updated and applicable to cryptocurrency service
providers. The challenge with tracking virtual currencies is that they are

identifiable only through a user’s exchange account or cryptocurrency wallet

address. In addition, the transactions are executed within seconds across
exchanges and jurisdictions, and often from cryptocurrency to fiat currency.

FATF has identified cryptocurrency red flags. Individuals and organizations

interacting with cryptocurrencies must understand the risks and red flags and

incorporate them into their risk assessments.

Key takeaways

•  Cryptocurrency exchanges can allow users to operate with high levels of

anonymity and be used to obscure and anonymize transactions.

•  Virtual currencies are challenging to track because they are identifiable

only through a user’s exchange account or cryptocurrency wallet address.

•  Cryptocurrency transactions are executed within seconds across
exchanges and jurisdictions, and often from cryptocurrency to fiat

currency. The rapid changes introduced by cryptocurrencies require a

consistent global approach in terms of law and regulation.

•

Individuals and organizations interacting with cryptocurrencies must

understand the risks and red flags and incorporate them into their risk

assessment.

Virtual currency (Case example: Dark web)

In September 2020, the US Department of Justice announced the results of an

international law enforcement operation targeting drug criminals who

operated on the darknet. Operation DisrupTor’s actions in the US and Europe

resulted in the arrest of 179 darknet drug traffickers and other criminals who

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 121

Version 6.44

engaged in tens of thousands of transactions involving illicit goods on both

sides of the Atlantic. The operation also resulted in the seizure of over US$6.5
million in cash and virtual currency, mainly Bitcoin, 500 kilograms of drugs

worldwide, and 63 firearms.

An unprecedented, coordinated international effort to disrupt opioid

trafficking on the darknet, Operation DisrupTor, was jointly conducted by the

US Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) and Europol. The
operation identified numerous darknet vendor accounts through which

criminals had been selling illicit goods on darknet market sites.

A common criminal pattern consisted of finding buyers on the dark web,
accepting cryptocurrency as prepayment, and shipping drugs to customers’

addresses through regular mail and other shipping services. One criminal

group operating in the US city of Los Angeles completed more than 18,000

individual drug sales on several darknet sites. The group was also supplying

other darknet vendors and street drug dealers.

The darknet offers its users anonymity, and cryptocurrencies, which are often

the preferred method of payment on darknet sites, provide an additional way

to veil transactions. According to the FBI, many drug users have grown more

comfortable logging onto their computers and buying narcotics in a few

minutes from their home than going to a street corner.

The darknet and its associated use of cryptocurrencies provides a large and

expanding marketplace that crosses national borders to enable illicit activity.

However, in an environment in which law enforcement action is identifying

darknet operators and their activities, darknet users are increasingly searching

for other ways to communicate, such as encrypted chat networks.

Key takeaways

•  Cryptocurrency is the preferred payment method for purchasing illicit

goods on the darknet.

•  Law enforcement is increasingly capable of countering encryption and

identifying anonymous data sources and transactions.

•  Criminals will always search for new avenues of communication to avoid

detection.

Corporate Vehicles Used to

Facilitate Illicit Finance

A corporate vehicle is a legal entity that allows an administrator to perform

commercial activities and manage assets on behalf of another person or

company. Various forms of corporate vehicles can be used to facilitate the
movement of illicit funds. For example, corporate vehicles can be misused for

money laundering, bribery and corruption activities, sheltering assets, and tax
evasion. Vehicles such as corporations, partnerships, and trusts are all

effective methods to maximize anonymity of ownership as well as its actual

purpose.

Public Companies and Private Limited
Companies

In most jurisdictions, corporate structure is distinguished between public

companies and private limited companies. For public companies, shares are

freely available and traded publicly, there is usually no limit to the number of

shareholders, information on ownership and its board of directors is publicly

available, and the companies are subject to significant regulation. Conversely,

private limited companies are not publicly traded, are restrictive in the

number of shares, can be owned by one or many, and are subject to minimal

regulatory oversight.

Limited liability companies (LLCs) are very common corporate vehicles that

are subject to misuse. LLCs are an attractive vehicle because they can be

owned or managed anonymously; virtually anyone can own or manage an

LLC, including foreign persons and other business entities.

A member of an LLC is equivalent to a shareholder in a corporation. A

manager of an LLC, on the other hand, is equivalent to an executive officer or

member of the board of directors. An LLC can lack managers, in which case

the members manage the LLC. FinCEN has undertaken a number of activities

to better monitor LLCs, because not every state (especially US domestic
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 123

Version 6.44

LLCs) undertakes the same measures and controls toward LLCs, particularly

in the monitoring, recording, and reporting of managers, ultimate
beneficiaries, and nominees.

International business corporations (IBCs) are entities formed outside a
person’s or business’s country of residence, typically in offshore jurisdictions,

for confidentially or asset protection purposes. IBCs permit the person to

reduce transparency between the owner in her home country and the
offshore entity where the company is registered. As a result, some benefits

include asset protection, access to multiple investment markets, estate

planning, legitimate tax benefits, and ability to serve as holding companies.
The inherent risks with IBCs are that they are usually created in tax havens and

typically require incorporation with a local agent, who may further reduce the
transparency of the IBC (e.g., serving as a nominee owner or director) and

facilitate opening accounts in the name of the IBC. Private investment

companies are established and used in a similar manner; however, they are

typically limited to holding investment assets in tax-neutral offshore financial

jurisdictions.

Bearer shares in corporate formation

Bearer bonds, bearer stock certificates, and bearer shares are prime money

laundering vehicles because they belong on the surface to the bearer. When

bearer securities are transferred, because there is no registry of owners, the
transfer takes place by physically handing over the bonds or share certificates.

Basically, the person who holds the bonds or shares gets to claim ownership.

Bearer shares offer many opportunities to disguise their legitimate ownership.

To prevent this strategy, FATF in its 40 Recommendations suggested that

employees of financial institutions conduct EDD and ask questions about the
identity of beneficial owners before issuing, accepting, and creating bearer

shares and trusts. Financial institutions should also keep registries of this

information and share it appropriately with law enforcement agencies.

Several FATF members do allow the issuance of bearer shares, maintaining

that they have legitimate functions in facilitating the buying and selling of such

securities through book entry transfers. They also can be used, according to

some sources, for concealing ownership for tax optimization purposes.

Bearer checks are unconditional orders (i.e., negotiable instruments) that,

when presented to a financial institution, must be paid to the holder of the

instrument rather than to a payee specified on the order itself. Bearer checks

are used in several countries. The financial institution is usually not obligated to

verify the identity of the presenter of a bearer check unless the transaction

exceeds a specific threshold. A non-bearer check may become a bearer

instrument, payable to the individual who presents it, when the original payee

has endorsed it.

Shell and Shelf Companies

Although shell companies can be created for legitimate purposes, they can

also be established with the primary objective of claiming the proceeds of

crime as legitimate revenue and/or to commingle criminal proceeds with

legitimate revenue. The use of shell and shelf companies to facilitate money
laundering is a well-documented typology, according to FATF.

FATF offers the following definitions:

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 125

Version 6.44

•  Shelf company: A corporation that has had no activity; it has been created
and “put on the shelf.” This corporation is then later sold to someone who
prefers a previously registered corporation over a new one.

•  Shell company or corporation: A company that at the time of incorporation

has no significant assets or operations

FATF issued a report called The Misuse of Corporate Vehicles, Including Trust

and Company Service Providers in which it states that the ease with which
corporate vehicles can be created and dissolved in some jurisdictions is of

particular concern. This allows the vehicles to be used not only for legitimate

purposes (e.g., business finance, mergers and acquisitions, and estate and tax
planning), but also by financial criminals to conceal the sources of funds, while

keeping their ownership concealed.

Shell companies can be set up in onshore as well as offshore locations, and

their ownership structures can take several forms. Shares can be issued to a

natural or legal person or in registered or bearer form. Some companies can

be created for a single purpose or to hold a single asset. Others can be

established as multipurpose entities. Shell companies are often legally

incorporated and registered by the criminal organization, but they have no

legitimate business. Often purchased “off the shelf” from lawyers,

accountants, and secretarial companies, they are convenient vehicles to

launder money. Sometimes, the stock of these shell corporations is issued in

bearer shares, which means that whoever carries them is the purported

owner. Tax haven countries and their strict secrecy laws can further conceal

the true ownership of shell corporations. In addition, the information may be

held by professionals who claim secrecy.

When FATF reviewed the rules and practices that impair the effectiveness of

money laundering prevention and detection systems, it found that shell

corporations and nominees are widely used mechanisms to launder the
proceeds from crime. The Money Laundering in Canada report offered four

related purposes for establishing or controlling a shell company for money

laundering:

1.  Shell companies accomplish the objective of converting the cash

proceeds of crime into alternative assets.

2.  Through the use of shell companies, the launderer can create the

perception that illicit funds have been generated from a legitimate source.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 126

Version 6.44

Once a shell company is established, commercial accounts can be created

at banks and other financial organizations. Especially attractive to money
launderers are businesses that typically handle a high volume of cash

transactions, such as retail stores, restaurants, bars, video arcades, gas
stations, and food markets. Illicit revenues can then be deposited into bank

accounts as legitimate revenue, either alone or commingled with revenue

legitimately produced from the business. Companies also offer criminals
legitimate sources of employment in the community, which in turn helps

cultivate an image of respectability.

3.  Once a shell company is established, a wide range of legitimate and/or

fake business transactions can be used to facilitate the laundering process.

These include lending money between criminally controlled firms, paying
for fictitious expenses or salaries, disguising the transfer of illicit funds

under the guise of payment for goods or services, purchasing real estate

with the proceeds of crime, or disguising payments for real estate as

mortgages issued by a shell company. As a medium between criminal

organizations and other laundering vehicles, shell companies are flexible

and can be tailored to a launderer’s specific needs. For example, criminal

organizations that launder money through real estate can incorporate real

estate agencies, mortgage-brokerage firms, and development or

construction companies to facilitate access to real property.

4.  Shell companies can also be effective in concealing criminal ownership.
Nominees can be used as owners, directors, officers, and shareholders.

Companies in one country can also be incorporated as subsidiaries of

corporations based in another country (especially a tax haven country with

strict secrecy and disclosure laws), thereby significantly inhibiting

investigations into their ownership. Shell companies can also be used to

hide criminal ownership in assets, by registering these assets, such as real

estate, in the name of a company.

Criminal enterprises also use real businesses to launder illicit money. These

businesses differ from shell companies in that they operate legitimately,
offering industrial, wholesale, and retail goods or services.

The Canadian report identifies the following money laundering techniques

used in conjunction with criminally controlled companies:

•  Using nominees as owners or directors: To distance a company from its

criminal connections, nominees are used as company

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 127

Version 6.44

owners, officers, and directors. Nominees will often, but not always, have

no criminal record. Further, companies established by lawyers are often
registered in the lawyers’ names.

•  Layering: In some cases, several companies are established, many of which
are connected through a complex hierarchy of ownership. This method

helps to conceal criminal ownership, facilitates the transfer of illicit funds

between companies, and complicating any paper trail.

•  Loans: Proceeds of crime can be laundered by lending money between

criminally controlled companies. In one case, a drug trafficker had

US$500,000 in a bank account in the name of a shell company. These
funds were loaned to restaurants in which the drug trafficker had invested.

This seemingly legitimate use of the funds helped make it appear as

though the funds were being properly integrated into the economy. The

US$500,000 was repaid with interest to avoid suspicion.

•  Fictitious business expenses/false invoicing: Once a criminal enterprise
controls corporate entities in different jurisdictions, it can employ a

laundering technique known as double invoicing. An offshore corporation

orders goods from its subsidiary in another country, and the payment is

sent in full to the bank account of the subsidiary. Both companies are

owned by the criminal enterprise, and the payment for goods is actually a

repatriation of illicit money previously sent out of the country. Moreover, if

the subsidiary has charged a high price for the goods, the records of the

parent company will show a low level of profit, and it will pay less in taxes.

Conversely, an offshore corporation buys goods from a parent company at

an inflated price. The difference between the actual price and the inflated

price is then deposited in the subsidiary’s account.

•  Sale of the business: When the criminal sells the business, he has a

legitimate source of capital. The added benefit of selling a business

through which illicit money circulates is that it will seemingly exhibit

significant cash flow and, as such, will be an attractive investment that

could realize a high selling price.

•  Buying a company already owned by the criminal enterprise: This laundering

method is most frequently used to repatriate illicit money that was

previously secreted to foreign tax havens. Criminal proceeds from

offshore are used to buy a company that is already owned by the criminal

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 128

Version 6.44

enterprise. In this way, the launderer successfully returns a large sum of

money that had been secreted out of the country.

•  Paying out fictitious salaries: In addition to claiming the proceeds of crime
as legitimate business revenue, criminally controlled companies can help
make participants in a criminal conspiracy appear to be legitimate by

paying them salaries.

Trusts

Trusts are private fiduciary arrangements that allow a grantor, or settlor, to
place assets for future distribution to beneficiaries. The grantor/settlor will

usually appoint a third party, a trustee, to administer the assets in accordance

with the instructions provided in the trust document. Trusts are often seen as

separate legal entities from the grantor; as such, they are often useful for

estate planning and asset protection purposes. The instructions usually state

how the grantor/settlor wants the funds to be distributed and are limited only
to a legal purpose.

Trusts fall into one of two categories: revocable and irrevocable. In revocable

trusts, the grantor/settlor can terminate the trust. In irrevocable trusts, the

grantor cannot terminate the trust once it is created. The flow of funds from

the trust assets (i.e., the principal) to the beneficiaries can occur in several

ways, including providing them with the income generated by the principal,

providing fixed distributions of interest and/or principal, or putting conditions

on distributions (e.g., completing certain levels of schooling). Trusts also name

“remaindermen,” who are designated to receive any residual assets after the

conclusion of the trust’s term (e.g., after the death of the grantor or the

beneficiaries). Trusts allow a significant amount of flexibility and protection

and have been used legitimately for centuries.

The significance of trust accounts—whether onshore or offshore—in the

context of money laundering cannot be overstated. It can be used in the first

stage of converting illicit cash into less suspicious assets; help disguise the

criminal ownership of funds and other assets; and form an essential link

between different money laundering vehicles and techniques, such as real

estate, shell and active companies, nominees, and the deposit and transfer of
criminal proceeds.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 129

Version 6.44

In some jurisdictions, trusts can be formed to take advantage of strict secrecy

rules in order to conceal the identity of the true owner or beneficiary of the
trust property. They are also used to hide assets from legitimate creditors,

protect property from seizure under judicial action, and mask the various links
in the money flows associated with money laundering and tax evasion

schemes. For example, an asset protection trust (APT) is a form of irrevocable

trust that is usually created (i.e., settled) offshore for the principal purposes of
preserving and protecting part of one’s wealth from creditors. Title to the

asset is transferred to a person named the trustee. APTs are generally used

for asset protection and are usually tax neutral. Their ultimate function is to
provide for beneficiaries. Some proponents advertise APTs as allowing foreign

trustees to ignore US court orders and simply transfer the trust to another
jurisdiction in response to legal action threatening the trust’s assets.

Payments to the beneficiaries of a trust can also be used in the money

laundering process, because these payments do not need to be justified as
compensation or as a transfer of assets for services rendered.

Lawyers often serve as trustees by holding money or assets “in trust” for

clients. This enables lawyers to conduct transactions and administer the

client’s affairs. Sometimes, illicit money is placed in a law firm’s general trust

account in a file set up in the name of a client, nominee, or a company

controlled by the client. Trust accounts are also used as part of the normal

course of a lawyer’s duties in collecting and disbursing payments for real

property on behalf of clients.

Terrorist Financing

After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the finance ministers of the
Group of Seven (G-7) met on October 7, 2001, in Washington, D.C., and urged

all nations to freeze the assets of known terrorists. Since then, many countries

have committed to helping disrupt terrorist assets by alerting financial
institutions about persons and organizations that authorities determine are

linked to terrorism. The G-7 nations marshaled FATF to hold an “extraordinary
plenary session” on October 29, 2001, in Washington to address terrorist

financing. As a result, FATF issued the first eight of its Special

Recommendations, which have since been incorporated into the current

FATF Recommendations. (See the chapter "International AML/CFT Standards"

for more detail.)

Recommendation 5 encourages countries to criminalize terrorist financing

and the financing of terrorist organizations and individual terrorists with or

without a link to a specific terrorist act, as well as ensuring these crimes are

designated as money laundering predicate offenses. This designation allows

the application of money laundering statutes to terrorist financing and the

potential for greater prosecution and deterrence. Cutting off financial support

to terrorists and terrorist organizations is essential to disrupting their

operations and preventing attacks.

Differences and Similarities between
Terrorist Financing and Money Laundering

Money laundering and terrorist financing are often mentioned together, but

there are critically important differences between the two crimes. Many of the

controls that businesses implement are intended to serve the dual purposes

of combating money laundering and preventing terrorist financing. The

controls instituted to combat money laundering also strengthen the ability to

identify, deter, and disrupt terrorist financing. Of note, over half of the

individuals investigated by US law enforcement for ties to terrorist

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 131

Version 6.44

organizations and associated BSA records had engaged in suspected money

laundering, including structuring.

But money laundering and terrorist financing are separate crimes. Although

there is no workable financial profile for operational terrorists, there are key
distinctions that can help compliance officers understand the differences and

distinguish suspicious terrorist financial activity from money laundering.

The most basic difference between the two crimes involves the origin of the
funds. Terrorist financing uses funds for an illegal political purpose, but the

money is not necessarily derived from illicit proceeds. The purpose of

laundering funds intended for terrorists is to support terrorist activities. The
individuals responsible for raising the funds are not typically the beneficiaries

of the laundered funds; rather, the money benefits terrorist activity. On the

other hand, money laundering always involves the proceeds of illegal activity.

The purpose of laundering is to enable the money to be used legally. The

individuals responsible for the illegal activity are usually the ultimate
beneficiaries of the laundered funds.

From a technical perspective, the laundering methods used by terrorists and

other criminals are similar. Although it would seem logical that funding from

legitimate sources does not need to be laundered, terrorist groups do need to

disguise the link between them and their legitimate funding sources, in part to

ensure the continued and uncompromised future use of sources. In doing so,

the terrorists use methods similar to those of criminal organizations, such as

cash smuggling; structuring; purchase of monetary instruments; wire
transfers; and use of debit, credit, and prepaid cards.

The hawala system is an informal value-transfer system involving the

international transfer of value outside the legitimate banking system. Based on

a trusted network of individuals, this system has also played a role in moving

terrorist-related funds. In addition, money raised for terrorist groups can be

used for mundane expenses, such as food and rent; it is not always strictly

used for the terrorist acts themselves.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

Detecting Terrorist Financing

The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States

determined that neither the September 11 hijackers nor their financial
facilitators were experts in the use of the international financial system. The

terrorists created a paper trail linking them to one another and their

facilitators. Still, they were adept enough to blend into the vast international
financial system without revealing themselves as criminals. The money

laundering controls in place at the time were largely focused on drug
trafficking and large-scale financial fraud; they were not sufficiently focused

on the types of transactions made by the hijackers. Following 9/11,

international efforts to detect and deter terrorist financing increased

significantly. Conversely, in response to these efforts, terrorists and terrorist

financiers have adapted, expanding and varying their methods of raising and

moving funds, requiring increased innovation and vigilance by law
enforcement and financial institutions.

In an attempt to clarify terrorist financing and offer recommendations to the

global financial community, FATF issued guidance to identify techniques and

mechanisms used in financing terrorism and described the general

characteristics of terrorist financing. Its objective is to help organizations

determine when transactions merit additional scrutiny so they can better

identify, report (when appropriate), and ultimately avoid transactions involving

funds associated with terrorist activity. FATF suggests that organizations
exercise “reasonable judgment” in evaluating potential suspicious activity.

To avoid becoming conduits for terrorist financing, organizations must

consider, among other things, the following factors:

•  Use of an account as a front for a person with suspected terrorist links

•  Appearance of an account holder’s name on a list of suspected terrorists

•  Frequent large cash deposits in accounts of nonprofit organizations

•  High volumes of transactions in accounts

•  Lack of a clear relationship between the banking activity and the nature of

the account holder’s business

FATF suggests that, with these scenarios in mind, organizations pay close
attention to the classic indicators of money laundering, including dormant,

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 133

Version 6.44

low-sum accounts that suddenly receive wire transfer deposits followed by

daily cash withdrawals that continue until the transferred sum is removed, as
well as lack of cooperation by a customer in providing required information.

Detecting terrorist financing (Case
example: The Maute Group)

The threat of terrorism financing involves the risk that funds and other assets

intended for terrorists are being raised, moved, stored, or used in or through a
jurisdiction. Systemic vulnerabilities can allow these activities to go

undetected, which can have dire consequences. Understanding the threat

environment and systemic vulnerabilities can facilitate the detection and

disruption of terrorism financing. Experience shows that ongoing

engagement with foreign counterparts is particularly important in both

detecting and assessing cross-border terrorist financing risks.

The 2018 Analyst Exchange Program (AEP) was a multinational project

involving financial intelligence analysts from Australia, the Philippines, Malaysia,

and Indonesia. The goal was to identify and understand the flow of funds,

fighters, and material support to the radical Islamist Maute Group and

associated groups in the Philippines prior to and during the Marawi Siege in
2017.

The AEP initiative identified money-moving networks, probable fund sources,

networks used, and previously unknown financiers and facilitators that were

utilized to finance terrorist groups in the Southern Philippines. The Maute

terrorists were trained by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and gained

experience in Syria and Iraq, or they were trained locally by a wealthy Muslim

family, the Maute family. They were funded by:

•  The Maute family

•

ISIS

•  The sale of shabu, a slang term for methamphetamine

•  Anonymous mobile payments

During the AEP program, information was shared among the participants,

including financial intelligence unit reports, transaction reports, and

intelligence from domestic authorities and the private sector. This information

has supported ongoing investigations.

Key takeaways

•  Terrorists need to raise, move, store, and use funds in order to sustain their

operations.

•  Countries must identify, assess, and understand terrorist financing risk as

an essential part of dismantling and disrupting terrorist networks.

•  Engaging with foreign counterparts is important in detecting and assessing

cross-border terrorist financing risks.

•

It’s important to establish procedures and mechanisms to handle the

exchange of sensitive information at an early stage in collaboration.

How Terrorists Raise, Move, and Store
Funds

Global sanctions efforts have reduced funding to organizations from

traditional state sponsors of terror, leading those organizations to seek

supplemental sources of income to conduct their activities. In a December

2015 United Nations Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Ban Ki-

moon told the Council: “Terrorists take advantage of weaknesses in financial

and regulatory regimes to raise funds. They circumvent formal channels to

avoid detection and exploit new technologies and tools to transfer resources.

They have forged destructive and very profitable links with drug and criminal

syndicates—among others. And they abuse charitable causes to trick

individuals to contribute. Terrorists continue to adapt their tactics and diversify

their funding sources,” which he noted include raising money through the oil

trade, extortion, undetected cash couriers, kidnapping for ransom, trafficking
of humans and arms, and racketeering.

Use of Hawala and Other Informal Value
Transfer Systems

Alternative remittance systems, or informal value transfer systems (IVTSs), are

often associated with ethnic groups from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

These systems commonly involve the international transfer of value outside
the legitimate banking system and are based on trust. The systems are

referred to by different names depending upon the country: “hawala” (an
Arabic word meaning change or transform), “hundi” (a Hindi word meaning

collect), “chiti banking” (referring to the way the system operates), “chop

shop banking” (China) and “poey kuan” (Thailand).

Hawala was created centuries ago in India and China before Western financial

systems were established to facilitate the secure and convenient movement

of funds. Merchant traders wishing to send funds to their homelands would

deposit them with a hawala broker, or hawaladar, who typically owned a

trading business. For a small fee, the hawaladar would arrange for the funds to

be made available for withdrawal from another hawaladar, typically also a

trader, in another country. The two hawaladars would settle accounts through

the normal process of trade.

Today, the process works much the same way, with people in various parts of

the world using their accounts to move money internationally for third parties.

In this way, deposits and withdrawals are made through hawala bankers rather

than traditional financial institutions. The third parties are typically immigrants

or visiting workers who send small sums to their homelands to avoid bank fees

for wire transfers. Reasons for legitimate use of hawala and other IVTS include

less expensive and faster money transmission, lack of banking access in the

remittance-receiving country, cultural preference, and lack of trust in the

formal banking system. There is usually no physical movement of currency

and typically a lack of formality regarding verification and recordkeeping. The

money transfer takes place by coded information that is passed through chits,

couriers, letters, faxes, emails, text messages, and online chat systems,

followed by some form of telecommunications confirmation. Almost any

document that carries an identifiable number can be used by the receiver to

pick up the values in the other country.

Version 6.44

As AML/CFT measures have proliferated around the world, the use of hawala,

which operates without governmental supervision, is believed to have
become more appealing to money launderers and terrorists. FATF has said

that regulation and supervision of hawalas and other similar service providers
remains a key challenge to authorities. It also notes that, as in other sectors,

money laundering and terrorist financing risk increases the less regulation and

supervision the hawala and similar service providers are subjected to. These
providers are attractive to launderers because they leave little to no paper

trail; the details of the customers who will receive the funds are

communicated to the receiving brokers via telephone, fax, and email.
Authorities have observed the use of advanced internet technologies by

hawala and other similar agents and suspect they are exclusively using

protected online services to conduct their activities and maintain their

accounts, leaving no manual accounts.

Because hawala is a remittance system, it can be used at any phase of the

money laundering cycle. It can provide an effective means of placement:

When the hawaladar receives cash, he can deposit the cash in bank accounts.

He will justify these deposits to bank officials as the proceeds of legitimate

business. He may also use some of the cash received to pay for his business

expenses, reducing his need to deposit the cash into a bank account.

Hawaladars often operate within or in addition to a legitimate or front business

to provide cover for the activity and commingle the funds in the business

accounts.

A component of many layering schemes is transferring money from one

account to another, while avoiding leaving a paper trail. A basic hawala

transfer leaves little if any paper trail. Hawala transfers can be layered to make

following the money even more difficult. This can be done by using

hawaladars in several countries and distributing the transfers over time.

Hawala techniques can be used to convert money into almost any form,

offering many possibilities for establishing an appearance of legitimacy in the

integration phase of the money laundering cycle. The money can be

reinvested in a legitimate (or legitimate-appearing) business. A hawaladar

could, for example, very easily arrange for the transfer of money from the

United States to Pakistan and then back to the United States, apparently as
part of an investment in a business there.

Hawalas are attractive to terrorist financiers because, unlike formal financial

institutions, they are not consistently subject to formal government oversight

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

and are not required to keep detailed records in a standard form. Although

some hawaladars do keep ledgers, their records are often written in
idiosyncratic shorthand and are maintained only briefly. Al-Qaeda moved

much of its money by hawala before September 11, 2001, using approximately
12 trusted hawaladars who almost certainly knew of the source and purpose

of the money. Al-Qaeda also used unwitting hawaladars who probably

strongly suspected that they were dealing with al-Qaeda, but they were
nevertheless willing to engage in the transactions.

Detecting terrorist financing (Case
example: Use of hawala and other informal
value transfer systems)

On August 18, 2011, Mohammad Younis pled guilty in Manhattan federal court

to operating an unlicensed money transfer business between the United

States and Pakistan. One of the money transfers was used to fund the May 1,

2010, attempted car bombing in New York City’s Times Square by Faisal

Shahzad, who is serving a life sentence in federal prison. From January to May

2010, Younis provided money transmitting services to individuals in the New

York City area by assisting in the operation of a hawala. On April 10, 2010,

Younis engaged in two separate hawala transactions with customers who

traveled from Connecticut and New Jersey to meet with him in Long Island. In

each of the transactions, Younis provided thousands of dollars in cash to the

individuals at the direction of a coconspirator in Pakistan, but without

knowledge of how the customers were planning to use the funds. At no time

did Younis have the license to operate a money transmitting business from

either state or federal authorities.

One of the individuals to whom Younis provided money was Shahzad, who on

June 21, 2010, pled guilty to a 10-count indictment charging him with crimes

relating to his attempt to detonate a car bomb in Times Square on May 1, 2010.

During the course of his plea allocution, Shahzad acknowledged receiving a

cash payment in April 2010 in the United States to fund his preparations for the

bombing. According to Shahzad, the April cash payment was arranged in

Pakistan by associates of the Tehrik-e-Taliban, the militant extremist group

based in Pakistan that trained him to make and use explosive devices. On

September 15, 2010, Younis was arrested by the FBI and other agents of the

New York Joint Terrorism Task Force. Younis pled guilty to one count of
conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Key takeaways

•  Unlicensed money transfer businesses, or hawalas, can be used to easily
transfer sums of funds from high-risk jurisdictions at the direction of an
unidentified third party.

•  Hawalas can be particularly useful for moving funds for illicit purposes,
especially when a hawaladar is unlicensed and not subject to AML/CFT
requirements.

•  The combination of the ease with which funds can be moved to and from

high-risk jurisdictions and the limited level of scrutiny applied to

transactions makes hawala especially attractive for terrorist financing.

Use of Charities and Nonprofit
Organizations (NPOs)

After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the US government initiated the

Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) to identify, track, and pursue the

funding sources of terrorist groups. Through the TFTP, the US government has

uncovered and shut down over 40 designated charities that were used as

potential fundraising front organizations.

Knowingly or not, charitable organizations have served as vehicles for raising

and laundering funds destined for terrorism. As a result, some charities,

particularly those with Muslim connections, have experienced a large drop in

donations or have become targets of what they claim are unfair investigations

and accusations. FATF acknowledges the importance of the nonprofit

organization (NPO) sector to the global community. However, FATF found that

more than a decade after the abuse of NPOs by terrorists and terrorist

organizations was formally recognized as a concern, the terrorism threat to

the sector remains. The sector continues to be misused and exploited by

terrorist organizations through a variety of means.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 140

Version 6.44

Charities and NPOs have the following characteristics that are particularly

vulnerable to misuse for terrorist financing:

•  Enjoying the public trust

•  Having access to considerable sources of funds

•  Being cash-intensive

•  Frequently having a global presence, often in or next to areas exposed to

terrorist activity

•  Often being subject to little or no regulation and/or having few obstacles to

their creation

To help legitimate NPOs avoid ties to terrorist-related entities and regain

public trust, FATF issued guidelines on best practices for charities in

combating the abuse of NPOs. The guidance helps countries implement

Recommendation 8 on NPOs in line with the risk-based approach, that is, to

assist NPOs in mitigating terrorist-financing threats and assist financial

organizations in the proper implementation of the risk-based approach when
providing financial services to NPOs.

The objective of Recommendation 8 is to ensure that NPOs are not abused

by:

•  Terrorist organizations posing as legitimate entities

•  Exploiting legitimate entities as conduits for terrorist financing

•  Concealing or obscuring the clandestine diversion of funds intended for

legitimate purposes to terrorist organizations

The best practices address identification and mitigation of risk by countries

and NPOs alike, self-regulation by NPOs, and access of NPOs to financial

services.

FATF recommends that NPOs maintain and be able to present full program

budgets that account for all expenses, and conduct independent internal and

external field audits, the latter to ensure funds are being used for intended
purposes.

FATF recommends that charities use formal bank accounts to store and

transfer funds so that they are subject to the banks’ regulations and controls.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 141

Version 6.44

In turn, the banks where the accounts are established should manage NPOs

like other customers, apply their KYC rules, and report suspicious activities.

The Charity Commission is an independent regulator of charities in England

and Wales. Its role is to protect the public’s interest in charities and ensure that
charities further their charitable purposes for the public benefit and remain

independent from private, government, and political interests. Its counter-

terrorism strategy report dictates a four-strand approach to preventing abuse
of charities by terrorist financiers, including:

1.  Cooperation with government regulators and law enforcement nationally

and internationally

2.  Raising awareness in the sector of the risks charities face from terrorism

3.  Oversight and supervision through proactive monitoring of the sector in

areas identified as being at higher risk

4.  Intervention when abuse, or the risk of abuse, related to terrorist activity is

apparent

Detecting terrorist financing (Case
example: Using NPOs)

Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) are an integral part of the global landscape.

NPOs provide critically needed humanitarian aid around the world, especially

to disadvantaged people in some of the most corrupt and under-governed

territories, which often serve as “incubators” for terrorists. NPOs are at high
risk for exploitation by terrorists.

The most commonly observed method of exploitation of NPOs to support

terrorism involves the diversion of funds. In this typology, funds raised by NPOs

for humanitarian programs are diverted to support terrorism at some stage of

the NPO’s business process; funds raised for charitable purposes are

redirected to terrorists. Diversion occurs via internal actors, such as directing

officials and staff, and via third-party associates.

Other less common methods of exploiting NPOs include affiliation with a

terrorist entity, abuse of programing, support for recruitment, false

representation, and sham NPOs.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 142

Version 6.44

The diversion of funds can be carried out by individuals who are internal to the

organization. For example, a domestic NPO was raising funds for humanitarian
relief in an area of conflict. The NPO used collection boxes outside religious

institutions to solicit donations. The funds raised were held in a domestic bank
account. The founder of the NPO was suspected of diverting the funds to

facilitate terrorism rather than using them for the stated humanitarian

activities. A law enforcement investigation resulted in the arrest of the founder
of the NPO for terrorism facilitation offenses. In addition, US$60,000 in

collected funds were seized.

The diversion of funds can also be perpetrated by individuals who are external
to the organization. For example, a domestic NPO was established to support

charitable work in foreign areas of conflict. An investigation by the national
financial intelligence unit was initiated following suspicious transaction

reporting. It revealed that locally collected funds were being transmitted to

foreign-based charitable organizations. The investigation also uncovered that,

once the funds were received by the foreign-based NPOs, they were

systematically passed on to persons or organizations that were part of, or

affiliated with, a known terrorist organization. Although there were established

connections between the foreign-based charitable organizations and the

terrorist organization, direct links between the domestic NPO and the terrorist
organization could not be substantiated.

Key takeaways

•  NPOs are at high risk for exploitation by terrorists.

•  The diversion of funds occurs when funds raised for charitable purposes

are redirected to support terrorist activity.

•  The diversion of funds can be perpetrated by individuals internal and

external to the organization.

•  Diverted funds are used to support terrorist activities both domestically

and abroad.

Detecting terrorist financing (Case
example: NPOs and Islamic Defenders Front
of Indonesia)

The nonprofit organization (NPO) sector has inherent vulnerabilities, which

terrorist entities seek to exploit. A key risk that NPOs face is that they operate

in the same vulnerable environments in which terrorists operate. One method
of exploitation of NPOs to support terrorism is to form an operational affiliation

between an NPO and a terrorist entity. These affiliations can range from

informal personal connections involving NPO directors and terrorist entities to
more formalized relationships.

In a typical affiliation, the NPO’s internal actors, usually directing officials and

staff, have established links to a terrorist entity. These internal actors are able

to exercise influence over the operations of the NPO, which ultimately support

terrorist entities. This can include the collection, transfer, retention, and

expenditure of resources, and the delivery of programs. The affiliation involves

every element of NPO operations.

The Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) was a hardline Islamist organization founded

in Indonesia in 1998 by Muhammad Rizieq Shihab. The FPI originally positioned

itself as the Islamic moral police against vice, and it conducted mostly illegal
and unauthorized vigilante operations.

FPI gained support by appearing to be an NPO that provided voluntary-based

welfare services in disaster-struck and poverty-ridden regions and

neighborhoods. It provided schooling, food supplies, and other humanitarian

aid. The Indonesian government alleged that Rizieq Shihab pledged FPI’s

allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Former FPI members

were allegedly involved in the bombing of a cathedral in Makassar, Indonesia,

in early 2021.

On December 30, 2020, the Indonesian government issued a joint ministerial

decree banning FPI. The government claimed FPI had threatened Indonesia’s

national ideology, committed illegal raids and atrocities including terrorism,

and allowed its organizational permit to expire. The government claimed that

29 members of the group had been convicted of committing acts of terror

and that 100 FPI members had been convicted of other crimes. On January 6,

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 144

Version 6.44

2021, Indonesia’s financial intelligence unit, the Financial Transaction Reports

and Analysis Centre (PPATK) froze FPI’s bank accounts to prevent the transfer
of funds and use of funds from the accounts that were known or suspected to

draw funds for illegal activity.

Key takeaways

•  A key risk that NPOs face is that they operate in the same vulnerable

environments in which terrorists operate.

•  Affiliations between NPOs and terrorists can range from informal personal

connections to more formalized relationships.

•

In NPOs that are exploited by internal actors affiliated with terrorist entities,

these individuals are able to exercise influence over the NPO’s operations

to ultimately support terrorist activities.

•  Organizations must know their NPO customers, their staff members, and

the individuals and entities with whom the NPO affiliates.

Emerging Risks for Terrorist Financing

FATF warns of several rising threats and vulnerabilities, including:

•  Self-funding by foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs)

•  Raising funds through social media

•  New payment products and services

•  Exploitation of natural resources

Self-funding by FTFs

Social media platforms, smartphone applications, and internet sharing sites

provide terrorist organizations with global reach at little to no cost. FTFs and

terrorist sympathizers can self-radicalize and communicate with terrorist

organizations more efficiently than ever before. Often, the low cost

associated with perpetrating a terrorist act on a soft target (i.e., a civilian,

nonmilitary target that is relatively unprotected and thus vulnerable to terrorist

attacks) makes it possible for such acts to be self-funded. Self-funding

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 145

Version 6.44

includes sources such as employment income, social assistance, family

support, and bank loans, which makes detection nearly impossible without the
association of other aggravating terrorist financing indicators.

Former FBI Director James Comey stated, “Terrorists, in ungoverned spaces,
disseminate poisonous propaganda and training materials to attract troubled

souls around the world to their cause. They encourage these individuals to

travel, but if they cannot travel, they motivate them to act at home. This is a
significant change from a decade ago.”

Raising funds through social media

Social media platforms make it possible to build social and information-

sharing networks like never before in human history. This technology presents

a unique opportunity for terrorist organizations to communicate and raise

money for their causes and the potential to reach into every home in every

country in near real time. Terrorists have leveraged social media through

methods such as crowdfunding and sharing of virtual and prepaid account

information. These methods present unique difficulties for law enforcement,

due to the increased dispersion of the activity and the need for cooperation
from both financial institutions and social media platforms.

New payment products and services

(See the section "Risks Associated with New Payment Products and

Services.")

Exploitation of natural resources

Terrorist organizations that hold or maintain control over territory or operate

in a country with poor governmental control of the territory can take control

of natural resources, such as gas, oil, timber, diamonds, gold and other

precious metals, wildlife (e.g., ivory trading), and historical artifacts, or extort

companies that extract those resources to both fund terrorist acts and

support day-to-day activities. These resources themselves might be sold on

the black market or to complicit companies, where they can then be
integrated into the global trade sector. An awareness of geographies in which

terrorist organizations operate and maintain control, knowledge of current

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 146

Version 6.44

commodity prices, and strong multijurisdictional partnerships are necessary

to combat this method of terrorist funding, which has the potential to
generate vast sums. Red flags include the association of a customer with

PEPs, complex legal entities structures with multiple internal transactions, and
the rapid shipment of resources to distant jurisdictions.

Detecting terrorist financing (Case
example: Islamic State cryptocurrency)

Criminal convictions for terrorist funding remain relatively rare. As criminals,

terrorists adapt and utilize new technology in the current operating

environment. However, law enforcement expertise and skills also are

becoming increasingly sophisticated, revealing funding methods and

technologies used by terrorists. Law enforcement can use the unique

investigative pathways presented by blockchain and cryptocurrencies to

identify, arrest, and prosecute individuals and organizations that fund

terrorism against states and individuals.

To combat the risks from terrorists using new technology, governments are

enacting laws and guidance and working with exchanges and wider financial

services to prevent misuse.

Terrorist organizations are continually exploring new ways to raise, store,

move, and use funds. The same is true for individual criminals, or “lone actors,”

who fund terrorist activity, often far from conflict zones. Increasingly, new

technological capabilities open channels for financing terrorism, and the use

of cryptocurrency is one of these.

In September 2021, at UK’s Birmingham Crown Court, Hisham Chaudhary, 28,

was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for one count of belonging to a

proscribed terrorist group, two counts of entering terrorist fundraising
arrangements, and four counts of disseminating terrorist publications.

As part of his role, from his home, Chaudhary received money from

supporters and transferred over £50,000 abroad using Bitcoin. These funds

paid smugglers to help captured ISIS militants escape from Kurdish-controlled

prison camps in northern Syria. The court heard that Chaudhary immersed

himself online on encrypted chat and video platforms, from which he spread

terrorist propaganda and solicited funds. He deliberately developed his
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 147

Version 6.44

understanding and use of cryptocurrency to facilitate these transfers and

used encrypted chat to communicate.

As is common, Chaudhary presented himself as a humanitarian and claimed

his funding had charitable intent. Law enforcement, working with partners in
cryptocurrency exchanges and financial services, rebutted this argument and

proved his sustained support and funding of terrorists.

Within regulated organizations, the first line of defense is responsible for
identifying and reporting suspicious cryptocurrency activity. Working in

partnership across all sectors is the most effective way of preventing financial

crime. This applies to terrorist financing as well, which is notoriously difficult to
identify by one agency alone.

Key takeaways

•  Terrorists are adapting to technology and increasingly conducting

transactions digitally, including through cryptocurrency.

•  Terrorists also use cyber-enabled tools to communicate.

•  Law enforcement employs tools and investigative techniques to identify

terrorist funding through misuse of cryptocurrency.

•  Criminals often attempt to disguise terrorist funding as humanitarian

activity.

•  The first line of defense is responsible for identifying and reporting

suspicious cryptocurrency activity.

Detecting terrorist financing (Case
example: Use of social media)

The global terrorist threat has shifted from being organizational to more

individual-centric, and the threat environment has gone from being more

centralized to decentralized. There are differences between the financial

requirements of terrorist groups and individual terrorists; however, they all

require funding to sustain their operations.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 148

Version 6.44

Social media can serve as a tool to facilitate and enable terrorist funding,

recruitment, and propaganda. Terrorist groups, individual terrorists, and
sympathizers are exploiting social media services to facilitate terrorist

financing. Social media services are commonly used as communication
channels by terrorists and their financiers to solicit funding. One advantage of

using social media platforms is that the large volume of legitimate funding

activity on these platforms can mask the comparatively small amount of
illegitimate activity.

According to the "Social Media & Terrorist Financing Report,” by the

Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) and the Middle East & North
Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF), multiple platforms have been

exploited by organized networks to collect donations for extremist
organizations.

One case was detected through suspicious matter reports (SMRs) received

by the Kuwait financial intelligence unit (FIU) from obliged reporting entities.

Social media services, including Facebook, YouTube, Telegram, Twitter, and

Instagram, were used to collect donations for extremist organizations. A

privately owned website linked to a suspect was also used. Social media

campaigns were created to solicit donations from the large number of

followers on the sites. They provided bank account details and phone

numbers for the people who collected the funds. Communication was

undertaken via the various social media platforms and WhatsApp.

Various methods of funding were used, including cash, ATM deposits, and

various internal and external transfers through banks, exchange companies,

bank websites, and standing orders of payment and checks. Although

communication was facilitated by social media platforms, no online payment
platforms such as PayPal were used.

Some of the funds were used to purchase flights. The remaining funds were

either transferred to other countries, where known terrorist organizations

exist, or to countries adjacent to them.

Monitoring and surveillance of social media platforms by law enforcement can

greatly enhance the detection of social media abuse by terrorists. Encryption,

the process of encoding information, is a challenge that hinders law

enforcement’s ability to monitor and detect terrorist financing. Some

examples of encrypted social media apps are WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal,

and iMessage.

International AML/CFT

Standards

Financial Action Task Force

The pace of international activity in the AML field accelerated in 1989 when the

G-7 nations launched FATF at its annual economic summit in Paris. With

France serving as its first chair, this multinational group started working toward

a coordinated effort against international money laundering.

Originally referred to as the G-7 Financial Action Task Force, today FATF

serves as the vanguard in promulgating AML guidance to governmental

bodies around the globe. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World

Bank also offer important perspectives to the field.

FATF has brought significant changes to the ways in which financial

organizations and businesses around the world conduct their affairs. It also

has brought about changes in laws and governmental operations.

The intergovernmental body is based at the Organisation for Economic Co-

operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, where it has its own secretariat.

FATF can be accessed online.

FATF Objectives

FATF’s stated objectives are to “set standards and promote effective

implementation of legal, regulatory, and operational measures for combating

money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity

of the international financial system. Starting with its own members, the FATF
monitors countries’ progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations;

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 151

Version 6.44

reviews money laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-

measures; and promotes the adoption and implementation of the FATF
Recommendations globally.”

FATF fulfills these objectives by focusing on several important tasks, including:

•  Spreading the AML message worldwide

•  Monitoring implementation of the FATF Recommendations among its

members

•  Reviewing money laundering trends and countermeasures

Spreading the AML message worldwide

FATF promotes the establishment of a global AML and anti-terrorist financing

network based on expansion of its membership, the development of regional

AML bodies in various parts of the world, and cooperation with other
international organizations.

Monitoring implementation of the FATF Recommendations

among its members

With its fourth round of mutual evaluations, FATF adopted a new approach to

assessing technical compliance with the Recommendations and determining

whether a member’s AML/CFT system is effective.

The new methodology was informed by the experience of FATF, FATF-Style

Regional Bodies (FSRBs), the IMF, and the World Bank in conducting

compliance assessments with earlier versions of the FATF Recommendations.

Collectively, the technical compliance and effectiveness assessments provide

an integrated analysis of the extent to which a country is compliant with the

FATF Recommendations and how successful it is in maintaining a strong

AML/CFT system. The methodology focuses on the technical compliance

assessment, effectiveness assessment, and reviewing money laundering

trends and countermeasures.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 152

Version 6.44

Technical compliance assessment

The technical compliance assessment evaluates the specific requirements of

the FATF Recommendations, including how a member relates them to its

relevant legal and institutional frameworks and the powers and procedures of
its competent authorities. The focus is on the fundamental building blocks of

an AML/CFT system.

For each Recommendation, assessors reach a conclusion about whether a

country complies with the FATF standard. The result is a rating of five possible

levels of technical compliance: compliant, largely compliant, partially
compliant, noncompliant, and not applicable.

Effectiveness assessment

The goal of the effectiveness assessment is to assess the adequacy of a

member’s implementation of the FATF Recommendations and ensure there

is evidence that a member is achieving a defined set of outcomes that are

central to a robust AML/CFT system. The focus is on the extent to which the

legal and institutional frameworks of the member are producing the expected

results and protecting the financial system from abuse.

FATF defines effectiveness as “the extent to which the defined outcomes are

achieved.” Effectiveness is evaluated on the basis of 11 Immediate Outcomes:

1.  Money laundering/terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks are known, and actions

are coordinated to combat or thwart the proliferation of ML/TF.

2.  International cooperation provides actionable information to use against

criminals.

3.  Supervisors regulate financial institutions and nonbank financial institutions

(NBFIs) and their risk-based AML/CFT programs.

4.  Financial institutions and NBFIs apply preventive measures and report

suspicious transactions.

5.  Legal persons are not misused for ML/TF, and beneficial ownership

information is available to authorities.

6.  Financial intelligence information is used by authorities in money

laundering and terrorist financing investigations.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 153

Version 6.44

7.  Money laundering offenses are investigated and criminally prosecuted, and

sanctions are imposed.

8.  Proceeds of crime are confiscated.

9.  Terrorist financing offenses are investigated and criminally prosecuted,

and sanctions are imposed.

10. Terrorists and terrorist organizations are prevented from raising, moving,

and using money and are not permitted to abuse NPOs.

11.  Persons and organizations involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass

destruction are prevented from raising, moving, and using money.

Each of the 11 Immediate Outcomes represents a key goal of an effective
AML/CFT system. They also feed into the three Intermediate Outcomes that

represent major thematic goals of AML/CFT measures:

1.  Policy, cooperation, and coordination to mitigate money laundering and

terrorist financing

2.  Prevention of proceeds of crime entering into the financial system and

reporting of such when they do

3.  Detection and disruption of ML/TF threats. For each individual immediate

outcome, assessors reach conclusions about the extent to which a country

is (or is not) effective and provide an effectiveness rating based on the

extent to which the core issues and characteristics are addressed. Ratings

include a high, substantial, moderate, or low level of effectiveness.

If a country has not reached a high level of effectiveness, assessors provide

reasons why it fell below the standard and recommend measures the country

should take to improve its ability to achieve the outcome.

Under the fourth round of FATF mutual evaluations, whether under regular or

an enhanced follow-up status, follow-up assessments are conducted after
five years.

FATF does not have the power to impose fines or penalties against

recalcitrant member nations. However, in 1996, FATF launched a policy for

managing nations that fail to comply with the FATF Recommendations, which

it describes as “a graduated approach aimed at enhancing peer pressure.”
This approach ranges from requiring the country to deliver a progress report

at plenary meetings to suspension of membership.

Version 6.44

In September 1996, Turkey became the first FATF member exposed to the

peer pressure policy. Although a member since 1990, Turkey had yet to
criminalize money laundering. FATF issued a warning to financial organizations

worldwide to be vigilant in their business relations and transactions with
people and entities in Turkey due to its lack of laundering controls. One month

later, Turkey enacted a money laundering law.

Turkey became the first country to be added to the FATF list of Jurisdictions
under Increased Monitoring. This list is often referred to the “greylist.”

Countries on the grey list have committed to resolve their identified strategic

deficiencies and are subject to increased monitoring.

Reviewing money laundering trends and countermeasures

Faced with a financial system that has few geographic limitations, operates

around the clock in every time zone, and maintains the pace of the global

electronic highway, criminals are constantly searching for new points of

vulnerability and adjusting their laundering techniques to respond to

countermeasures introduced by FATF members and other countries. As such,

FATF members are continually gathering information on money laundering

trends to ensure the organization’s Recommendations remain up to date. For

example, in October 2013, FATF and the Egmont Group of financial

intelligence units (FIUs) released a research report titled Money Laundering
and Terrorist Financing Through Trade in Diamonds, which examined the

vulnerabilities and risks of the “diamond pipeline” and described all sectors of

the diamond trade, including production, rough diamond sale, cutting and

polishing, jewelry manufacturing, and jewelry retailers.

Since its creation in 1989, FATF has been working under five-year mandates. In

2019, on FATF’s 30th anniversary, FATF members adopted of an open-ended

mandate. This mandate acknowledges that FATF’s mission will continue to

exist, as there are enduring concerns for the integrity of the financial system.

In addition, a sustained political commitment to fight money laundering,

terrorist financing, and proliferation financing is required. Since its
establishment, FATF has focused its work on three main activities:

•  Standard setting

•  Ensuring effective compliance with the standards

•

Identifying money laundering and terrorist financing threats

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 155

Version 6.44

These activities will remain at the core of FATF’s work. FATF will continue to

build on that work and respond to new and emerging threats, such as
proliferation financing and vulnerabilities in new technologies that could

destabilize the international financial system.

FATF 40 Recommendations

A key element of FATF’s efforts is its detailed list of appropriate standards for
countries to implement. These measures are detailed in the 40

Recommendations, which were first issued in 1990 and have since been
revised. FATF has also issued various Interpretative Notes, which are designed

to clarify the application of specific recommendations and provide additional

guidance.

After the events of September 11, 2001, FATF adopted and published the FATF

IX Special Recommendations on terrorist financing, which were later merged

into the 40 Recommendations.

FATF’s Recommendations have become the world’s blueprint for effective

national and international AML/CFT controls. The IMF and the World Bank have

recognized the FATF Recommendations as the international standard for

combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The IMF, World Bank, and

FATF use a common methodology to assess compliance with the FATF
Recommendations.

The FATF 40 Recommendations provide a complete set of countermeasures

against money laundering and terrorist financing, covering the following

elements:

•

Identification of risks

•  Development of appropriate policies

•  Criminal justice system and law enforcement

•  Financial system and its regulation

•  Transparency of legal persons and arrangements

•

International cooperation

FATF recognizes that, because countries have different legal and financial
systems, they cannot use identical measures to fight money laundering and

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 156

Version 6.44

terrorist financing. The Recommendations set minimum standards of action

for countries to implement according to their specific circumstances and
constitutional frameworks. With its 2012 revision, FATF introduced risk

assessment as the first recommendation, underscoring that assessing risk is
the first step in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.

With its 2003 revisions of the 40 Recommendations, FATF expanded the reach

of its global blueprint for preventing the illicit movements of funds. It
introduced substantial changes intended to strengthen measures to combat

money laundering and terrorist financing, which established further enhanced

standards by which countries can better fight these crimes.

The most important changes made to the Recommendations in 2003 were:

•  Expanded coverage to include terrorist financing

•  Widened the categories of business that should be covered by national
laws, including real estate agents, precious metals dealers, accountants,

lawyers, and trust services providers

•  Specified compliance procedures on issues such as customer

identification and due diligence, including enhanced identification

measures for high-risk customers and transactions

•  Adopted a clearer definition of money laundering predicate offenses

•  Encouraged prohibition of “shell banks,” which are typically established in
offshore secrecy havens and consist of little more than nameplates and

mailboxes

•  Urged improved transparency of legal persons and arrangements

•

Included stronger safeguards, notably regarding international cooperation

in, for example, terrorist financing investigations

In 2012, the Recommendations were revised again, to incorporate the IX

Special Recommendations on terrorist financing. The most important

changes in this revision were:

Highlights of the 40 Recommendations include:

•  Risk-based approach: Countries should start by identifying, assessing, and
understanding the money laundering and terrorist financing risks they

face. Then they should take appropriate measures to mitigate the

identified risks. The risk-based approach allows countries to allocate their

limited resources in a targeted manner in line with their own specific

circumstances to increase the efficiency of preventive measures. Financial

organizations should also use a risk-based approach to identify and

mitigate their risks.

•  Designated categories of offenses: The Recommendations specify crimes,
referred to as “designated categories of offenses,” which are considered

money laundering predicates (i.e., crimes that offenders attempt to

conceal through financial subterfuge that should constitute precursory

offenses to money laundering). Countries should also put in place

provisions to allow for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime or

otherwise prevent criminals from accessing their criminal proceeds.

•  Terrorist financing and financing of proliferation: Countries should

criminalize terrorist financing, including the financing of terrorist acts,

organizations, and individual terrorists, even if no terrorist activity can be

directly attributed to the provision of financing. Countries should impose

sanction regimes that allow them to freeze the assets of persons

designated by the United Nations Security Council for involvement in

terrorism or the proliferation of WMD. Countries should also establish

sufficient controls to mitigate the misuse of NPOs to provide support to

terrorists.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 161

Version 6.44

•  Knowledge and criminal liability: The Recommendations include the

concept that the knowledge required for the offense of money laundering
may be inferred from objective factual circumstances. This concept is

similar to what is known in some countries as “willful blindness,” or
deliberate avoidance of knowledge of the facts. In addition, the

Recommendations urge that criminal liability—or civil or administrative

liability, when criminal liability is not possible—should apply to legal persons
as well.

•  Customer due diligence measures: Financial organizations should conduct

CDD when they establish business relations, carry out occasional
transactions or wire transfers above the specified threshold (US$1,000 and

€1,000), have a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, and
have doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously obtained

customer identification information. Financial organizations must, using a

risk-based approach:

o

Identify the customer and verify the customer’s identity using reliable,

independent source documents, data, and information. Establishing

accounts in anonymous or obviously fictitious names should be

prohibited.

o  Take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner,
such that the financial organization is satisfied that it knows who the

beneficial owner is. For legal persons and arrangements, this

requirement includes understanding the ownership and control

structure of the customer.

o  Understand and, as appropriate, obtain information on the purpose and

intended nature of the business relationship.

o  Conduct ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and

scrutinize transactions undertaken in the course of that relationship to

ensure that they are consistent with the organization’s knowledge of

the customer, customer’s business and risk profile, and, when

necessary, source of funds.

o  Maintain records of the above customer information and all transactions

to enable compliance with requests from competent authorities.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 162

Version 6.44

o  Rely on other parties to conduct CDD in certain circumstances;

however, the relying institution remains liable for compliance with
completing the required CDD.

o  Establish a group-wide AML/CFT program for financial groups.

•  Additional CDD on specific customers and activities: Some customer types

and activities pose heightened risks, particularly the following:

o  PEPs: Appropriate steps must be taken to identify PEPs, including

obtaining senior management approval of such business relationships,

taking measures to establish the sources of wealth and funds, and

conducting ongoing monitoring.

o  Cross-border correspondent banking: Appropriate steps must be taken

to understand the respondent institution’s business, reputation,

supervision, and AML/CFT controls; obtain management approval of

such relationships; document the responsibilities of each institution;

mitigate risks associated with payable-through accounts; and ensure

accounts are not established for shell banks.

o  Money or value transfer services (MVTS): Countries should ensure that
MVTSs are licensed or registered and subject to appropriate AML/CFT

requirements.

o  New products, delivery mechanisms, and technologies: Countries and
financial organizations should assess the risks associated with the

development of new products, business practices, delivery

mechanisms, and technology. They should assess these risks prior to

launching new products and take appropriate measures to mitigate the

identified risks.

o  Wire transfers: Countries should require financial institutions to obtain

and send required and accurate originator, intermediary, and

beneficiary information with wires transfers and

related messages (travel rule). Financial institutions should monitor

wires for incomplete information and take appropriate measures. They

should also monitor wires for the involvement of parties designated by

the United Nations Security Council and take freezing actions or

otherwise prohibit the transactions from occurring. International wire

transfers are liquid and difficult to retrieve, which make them
susceptible to use as a tool by criminals to perform thefts or account

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 163

Version 6.44

takeovers to clear proceeds of crime. The requirements include virtual

assets and exchanges.

o  Suspicious activity reporting: Financial organizations must report to the
appropriate FIU when they suspect or have reasonable grounds to
suspect that funds are the proceeds of a criminal activity or are related

to terrorist financing. The financial organizations and employees

reporting such suspicions should be protected from liability for
reporting and prohibited from disclosing that they have reported such

activity. One of the main concerns related to sharing of suspicious

activity reports (SARs), the fact that a SAR has been filed, or the
underlying SAR information is ensuring their confidentiality, which is

critical to the effective functioning of the reporting regime.

•  Derisking: Derisking refers to the phenomenon of financial organizations
terminating or restricting business relationships with customers and

categories of customers to avoid, rather than manage, risk. This practice is

in line with FATF’s risk-based approach. Derisking can result from concerns

about profitability, prudential requirements, anxiety after a financial crisis,

and reputational risk, among other reasons. The Recommendations only

require financial organizations to terminate customer relationships, on a

case-by-case basis, when the money laundering and terrorist financing

risks cannot be mitigated.

•  Expanded coverage of industries: The Recommendations expand the fight
against money laundering by adding new nonfinancial businesses and

professions to the list of financial institutions that are the usual focus of

AML/CFT efforts. Expanding the scope of AML scrutiny is a key area on

which many governments have been aiming their efforts, in response to an

increased flow of illicit money. These designated nonfinancial businesses

and professions (DNFBPs) include:

o  Casinos when customers engage in financial transactions equal to or
above a designated threshold. At a minimum, casinos should be

licensed. Authorities should prevent criminals from participating in

casino operations and supervise casinos to ensure compliance with

requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

o  Real estate agents when they are involved in transactions for clients

concerning buying and selling properties

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 164

Version 6.44

o  Dealers in precious metals and stones when they engage in any cash
transaction with a customer at or above a designated threshold

o  Lawyers, notaries and independent legal professionals and accountants
when they prepare or carry out transactions for clients concerning
buying and selling real estate; managing client money, securities, and

other assets; establishing or managing bank, savings, and securities

accounts; organizing contributions for the creation or management of
companies; creating, operating, and managing legal persons or

arrangements; and buying and selling businesses

o  Trust and company service providers when they prepare or carry out
transactions for a client concerning certain activities (e.g., when acting

as a formation agent of legal persons, acting as a director or secretary

of a company, acting as a trustee of an express trust, or acting as a

nominee shareholder for another person)

FATF also designated specific thresholds that trigger AML scrutiny. For

example, the threshold that financial organizations should monitor for

occasional customers is US$15,000; for casinos, including internet casinos,

it is US$3,000; and for dealers in precious metals, when engaged in any

cash transaction, it is US$15,000.

•  Transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons and arrangements:

Countries should take appropriate measures to prevent the misuse of legal

persons for money laundering and terrorist financing, including ensuring

that information about the beneficial ownership and control of such legal

persons is available to competent authorities, particularly with regard to

legal persons who can issue bearer shares or have nominee shareholders

or directors.

•  Powers and responsibilities of competent authorities: Countries should

oversee financial organizations to ensure they are implementing the FATF

Recommendations and are not owned by or controlled by criminals. The

supervisors should be given sufficient resources and powers to effectively

oversee financial organizations within their jurisdictions. DNFBPs also

should be subject to oversight when they engage in certain financial

activities. Countries should establish FIUs and provide law enforcement

and investigative authorities with sufficient resources and powers to

investigate money laundering and terrorist financing and seize or freeze

criminal proceeds when found. Countries should implement measures to

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 165

Version 6.44

detect the physical cross-border movement of currency and bearer-

negotiable instruments. The authorities should provide meaningful
statistics, guidance, and feedback on AML/CFT systems.

•

International cooperation: Several Recommendations address
strengthening international cooperation. Countries should rapidly,

constructively, and effectively provide the widest possible range of mutual

legal assistance in money laundering and terrorist financing investigations,
freezing and confiscation of criminal proceeds, extradition, and other

matters. Countries should ratify United Nations conventions against

significant crimes and terrorism.

FATF Members and Observers

FATF originally comprised 16 member jurisdictions. It has rapidly increased in

membership and influence, and it now represents most major financial

centers around the globe. Refer to the FATF-GAFI website for a current list of
members and observers.

FATF membership criteria

The following criteria are applied when considering a country as a potential

candidate for FATF membership:

1.  The jurisdiction should be strategically important based on quantitative and

qualitative indicators and additional considerations.

•  Quantitative Indicators

o  Size of gross domestic product (GDP)
o  Size of the banking, insurance, and securities sectors
o  Population

•  Qualitative Indicators

o

Impact on the global financial system, including the degree of

openness of the financial sector and its interaction with international

markets

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 166

Version 6.44

o  Active participation in an FSRB and regional prominence in AML/CFT

efforts

o  Level of AML/CFT risks faced and efforts to combat those risks

•  Additional considerations

o  Level of adherence to financial sector standards
o  Participation in other relevant international organizations

2.  FATF’s geographic balance should be enhanced by the jurisdiction

becoming a member.

Process for FATF membership

Step 1—Engaging with the country and granting observership

•  The country should submit a written commitment at the

political/ministerial level:

o  Endorsing and supporting FATF Recommendations and the FATF
AML/CFT Methodology 2013 (as amended from time to time)

o  Agreeing to undergo a mutual evaluation during the membership
process for the purposes of assessing compliance with FATF

membership criteria, using the AML/CFT methodology applicable at the

time of the evaluation, as well as agreeing to submit subsequent follow-

up reports

o  Agreeing to participate actively in FATF and meet all the other

commitments of FATF membership, including supporting the role and

work of FATF in all relevant fora

•  The Plenary decides that a high-level visit to the country is warranted to

verify the written commitment with the relevant ministers, representatives

of the Parliament, and competent authorities. The visit will also determine

whether the country will be in a position to undergo a successful mutual

evaluation and achieve a satisfactory level of technical compliance,

including with the Recommendations essential for the establishment of a

robust AML/CFT regime, such as Recommendations 3, 5, 10, 11 and 20,

within 3 years. Consideration should also be given to the country’s level of
implementation of the essential Recommendations and its progress

toward assessing and addressing its ML/TF risks, as described in

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 167

Version 6.44

Recommendation 1. The high-level visit should include the FATF President,

selected members of the Steering Group, and heads of delegations. It is
accompanied by the FATF Secretariat. The report of the high-level visit is

presented at the following Plenary meeting.

•  Based on the outcomes of the report of the high-level visit, the Plenary
may decide to invite the country to participate in FATF as an observer,

beginning with the next Plenary meeting. If the Plenary decides not to
invite the country to attend FATF meetings as an observer, it may appoint a

contact group to advise as to the appropriate time to extend such an

invitation to the country. Then the contact group should engage with the
competent authorities of the country to determine when the country will

be able to undergo a successful mutual evaluation, as described in Step 2.
The contact group is open to all FATF members and associate members

and should include at least one member of the Steering Group. It is

assisted by the FATF Secretariat. It will meet regularly and reports on the

progress made by the country at each Plenary meeting.

Step 2—Carrying out a mutual evaluation, agreeing on an action plan, and

granting membership

Membership is granted if the mutual evaluation is satisfactory. A mutual

evaluation is not satisfactory if the country meets one of the following criteria:

Within a maximum of 3 years after being invited to participate in FATF as an

observer, the mutual evaluation process for the country should be launched.

During this period, a new contact group may assist the country to ensure that
it is ready for its mutual evaluation.

•  Has eight or more noncompliant/partially compliant (NC/PC) ratings for

technical compliance

•

Is rated NC/PC on any one or more of Recommendations 3, 5, 10, 11 and 20

•  Has a low or moderate level of effectiveness for seven or more of the 11

effectiveness outcomes

•  Has a low level of effectiveness for four or more of the 11 effectiveness

outcomes

If the mutual evaluation is not satisfactory, but it is close to being satisfactory,

the country should provide a clear commitment at the political/ministerial

level to reach the expected results within a reasonable timeframe (i.e., a

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 168

Version 6.44

maximum of 4 years). A detailed action plan including the steps to be taken

and timeframe is prepared by the country and reviewed by the second
contact group before its adoption by the FATF Plenary.

At each FATF meeting, the Plenary closely monitors the implementation of the
country’s action plan. If it is not satisfied with the pace and/or extent of

progress made, the Plenary can decide to apply to the country the enhanced

measures listed under paragraph 77 of the procedures for the FATF fourth
round of AML/CFT mutual evaluations. A country will not be granted full

membership if it is rated NC/PC on any one or more of Recommendations 3,

5, 10, 11 or 20. Other than that, the Plenary may decide, at any time during the
course of completion of the action plan and in light of the progress made by

the country, to grant full membership before the action plan is completed.

Noncooperative Countries

Since its inception, FATF has had a practice of “naming and shaming”

countries that it determines maintain inadequate AML controls or do not

cooperate in global AML/CFT efforts. For years, FATF was engaged in an

initiative to identify noncooperative countries and territories (NCCTs) in the

global fight against money laundering. It developed a process to seek out

critical weaknesses in specific jurisdictions’ AML systems that obstruct
international cooperation in this area.

On February 14, 2000, FATF published an initial report on NCCTs that listed the

25 criteria that help identify relevant detrimental rules and practices and that

are inconsistent with the 40 Recommendations. It described a process

whereby jurisdictions with such rules and practices can be identified and
encouraged to implement international standards in this area.

The 25 distinct criteria are categorized in the following four broad areas:

1.  Loopholes in financial regulations

•  No or inadequate regulations or supervision of financial organizations

•

Inadequate rules for the licensing or creation of financial organizations,

including assessing the backgrounds of managers and beneficial

owners

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 169

Version 6.44

•

Inadequate customer identification requirements for financial

organizations

•  Excessive secrecy provisions regarding financial organizations

•  Lack of efficient SAR reporting

2.  Obstacles raised by other regulatory requirements

•

Inadequate commercial law requirements for registration of business

and legal entities

•  Lack of identification of the beneficial owner(s) of legal and business

entities

3.  Obstacles to international cooperation

•  Obstacles to cooperation from administrative authorities

•  Obstacles to cooperation from judicial authorities

4.  Inadequate resources for preventing and detecting money laundering

activities

•  Lack of resources in public and private sectors

•  Absence of an FIU or equivalent mechanism

The goal of the NCCT process was to reduce the vulnerability of the financial

system to money laundering by ensuring that all financial centers adopt and

implement measures for the prevention, detection, and punishment of money

laundering, according to internationally recognized standards. The next step

in the NCCT initiative was the publication in June 2000 of the first review,

which identified 15 NCCTs. The NCCT process ultimately involved 24

jurisdictions, including up to 19 jurisdictions at one time, until the jurisdictions

eventually took the necessary steps to get off the list. At that point, FATF

ceased the process.

The NCCT list has been replaced by a new process whereby FATF started

identifying jurisdictions with deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes. This new

FATF process was in response to the G-20 countries’ efforts to publicly

identify high-risk jurisdictions and issue regular updates on jurisdictions with

strategic deficiencies. It was also in response to criticism of the term

“noncooperative,” as many noncompliant jurisdictions simply lack the tools
and infrastructure necessary to fight financial crime.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 170

Version 6.44

FATF’s two public documents

FATF identifies these jurisdictions in two public documents issued three times

a year.

The first document, High-Risk Jurisdictions Subject to a Call for
Action (previously known as Public Statement), identifies countries and

jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies that are so serious that FATF calls on its
members and nonmembers to apply EDD and, in the most serious cases,

countermeasures. This list is often referred to in the media as the “FATF

blacklist.”

The second document, Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring (previously

known as Improving Global AML/CFT Compliance: On-going process),

identifies countries that are already actively engaging with FATF to address

strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist

financing, and proliferation financing. Once a jurisdiction is under increased

monitoring, it means it has committed to swiftly resolve the identified

strategic deficiencies within an agreed-upon time frame, while FATF keeps it

under close scrutiny. This list is externally referred to as the “FATF greylist.”

FATF encourages its members to consider the strategic deficiencies

identified within these jurisdictions. If a country fails to make sufficient or

timely progress, FATF can increase its pressure on the country to make more

meaningful improvements by making it subject to a call for action. FATF also

names jurisdictions that are no longer subject to its ongoing global AML/CFT

compliance process. Typically, a country is considered to have made

significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime when it establishes a

legal and regulatory framework for meeting its commitments in its action plan

regarding the previously identified strategic deficiencies. However, the

country must continue to work with the appropriate FSRB to address the

items noted in its mutual evaluation report.

Review process

FATF’s International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) oversees the process

of identifying and reviewing jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies.

The process began in 2007 and was enhanced in 2009. It was updated in 2015

to reflect the revised FATF standards and mutual evaluation process. FATF
reviews jurisdictions based on threats, vulnerabilities, and specific risks. Thus, a
Page 171
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

jurisdiction will be reviewed when it refuses to participate in an FSRB, does not

allow its mutual evaluation results to be published in a timely manner, and/or
has achieved poor results on its mutual evaluation. Results are considered

“poor” when the jurisdiction has 20 or more noncompliant (NC) and partially
compliance (PC) ratings for technical compliance, or a low level of

effectiveness for 6 or more of the 11 immediate outcomes.

A jurisdiction that enters the ICRG review process as a result of its mutual
evaluation results is given a one-year observation period to work with FATF or

its FSRB to address deficiencies before possible public identification and a

formal review by FATF. FATF then prioritizes the review of those countries that
have more significant financial sectors, such as US$5 billion or more in financial

sector assets. When FATF deems a jurisdiction’s progress insufficient to
address its strategic deficiencies, it develops an action plan with the

jurisdiction to address the remaining strategic deficiencies. For all countries

under review, FATF requires a high-level political commitment that the

jurisdiction will implement the legal, regulatory, and operational reforms

required by the action plan.

The Basel Committee on Banking

Supervision

Introduction

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, established in 1974 by the
central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G-10) countries, promotes sound

supervisory standards worldwide. The Committee is the primary global
standard-setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum

for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen

the regulation, supervision, and practices of banks worldwide to enhance

financial stability. The Committee is best known for its landmark publications

on capital adequacy (Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III). The Committee’s

Secretariat is located at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel,

Switzerland, and it is staffed mainly by professional supervisors on temporary

assignment from member institutions.

History of the Basel Committee

Banking supervisors are generally not responsible for the criminal prosecution

of money laundering in their countries. However, they play an important role in
ensuring that banks have procedures in place, including strict AML/CFT

policies, to avoid involvement with drug traffickers and other criminals, as well

as generally promoting high ethical and professional standards in the financial
sector. The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal in the

early 1990s, the indictments and guilty pleas of former officials of the Atlanta
branch of the Italian Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in 1992, and other

international banking scandals prompted banking regulators in the richest

nations to agree on basic rules for the supervision and operation of
multinational banks.

In 1988, the Basel Committee issued a Statement of Principles, called

Prevention of Criminal Use of the Banking System for the Purpose of Money

Laundering, in recognition of the vulnerability of the financial sector to misuse

by criminals. This was the Committee’s first AML/CFT commitment and a step

toward preventing the use of the banking sector for money laundering. The

statement set out principles with respect to:

•  Customer identification

•  Compliance with laws

•  Conformity with high ethical standards and local laws and regulations

•  Full cooperation with national law enforcement to the extent permitted

without breaching customer confidentiality

•  Staff training

•  Recordkeeping and audits

These principles preceded AML legislation regarding the disclosure of

customer information to enforcement agencies and protection from civil suits

brought by customers for breach of confidentiality. Therefore, these

principles stressed cooperation within the confines of confidentiality. Since

1988, the Committee has continued to publish papers in support of these
commitments.

Version 6.44

In 1997, the Basel Committee issued its Core Principles for Effective Banking

Supervision, a basic reference for authorities worldwide. It stated that,
“Banking supervisors must determine that banks have adequate policies,

practices, and procedures in place, including strict ‘know-your-customer’
rules that promote high ethical and professional standards in the financial

sector and prevent the bank being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by

criminal elements.” It also urged nations to adopt FATF’s 40
Recommendations. The Core Principles were prepared with the assistance of

15 non-G-10 nations, including Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong Special Administrative

Region (SAR, China), Mexico, Russia, Singapore, and Thailand.

The Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision has been periodically

updated. The update in 2012 combined the core principles content with the
assessment methodology to create a more comprehensive document. It also

revised the structure of the 29 core principles, dividing them more clearly

between principles for banking supervisors and for banks.

The revised standards include a core principle (BCP 29) that specifically

addresses the abuse of financial services and emphasizes the need for

adequate policies and procedures, including CDD rules.

The Basel Committee’s KYC guidance centers on the use of due diligence

requirements to mitigate the dangers of corrupt customers. Without due

diligence, banks can be subject to reputational, operational, legal, and

concentration risks, which can result in significant financial cost. Sound KYC

policies and procedures are critical to protecting the safety and soundness of
banks, as well as the integrity of banking systems.

The Committee has addressed the importance of KYC standards for

supervisors and banks, essential elements of KYC standards, the role of
supervisors, and implementation of KYC standards in a cross-border context.

Specific issues emphasized include:

•  The four key elements of a KYC program:

o  Customer identification
o  Risk management

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 177

Version 6.44

o  Customer acceptance policy
o  Ongoing monitoring

•  Banks should not only establish the identity of their customers, but they
should also monitor account activity to identify transactions that do not
conform to the normal or expected transactions for that customer or type

of account. “To ensure that records remain relevant, there is a need for

banks to undertake regular reviews of existing records. An appropriate
time to do so is when a transaction of significance takes place, when

customer documentation standards change substantially, or when there is

a material change in the way that the account is operated.”

•  Numbered accounts should not be prohibited, but they should be
subjected to exactly the same KYC procedures as other customer

accounts. KYC tests may be carried out by select staff, but the identity of

customers must be known to an adequate number of staff if the bank is to

be sufficiently diligent. “Such accounts should in no circumstances be used

to hide the customer identity from a bank’s compliance function or from

the supervisors.”

•  Specific customer identification issues related to high-risk customers

include:

o  Trust, nominee, and fiduciary accounts
o  Corporate vehicles, particularly companies with nominee shareholders

or entities with shares in bearer form

Introduced businesses

o
o  Customer accounts opened by professional intermediaries, such as

pooled accounts managed by professional intermediaries on behalf of

entities such as mutual funds, pension funds, and money funds

o  PEPS
o  Non–face-to-face customers (i.e., customers who do not present

themselves for a personal interview)

o  Correspondent banking

•  Banks should develop customer acceptance policies and procedures that
describe the customer’s background, country of origin, business activities,

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 178

Version 6.44

and other risk indicators. They also should develop clear and concise

descriptions of who is an acceptable customer.

•  Private banking accounts should under no circumstances be allowed to

escape KYC policies.

•  Banks should make every effort to know the identity of corporations that
operate accounts and, when professional intermediaries are involved,

should verify the exact relationship between the owners and intermediary.

•  Banks should use standard identification procedures when dealing with

non–face-to-face customers and should never agree to open an account

for persons who are adamant about anonymity.

•  Periodic bank-wide employee training should be provided that explains the

importance of the KYC policies and AML requirements.

•

Internal auditors and compliance officials should regularly monitor staff

performance and adherence to KYC procedures.

•  Continued monitoring of high-risk accounts by compliance personnel

should be conducted to obtain a greater understanding of the customers’

normal activities and enable the updating of identification papers and

detection of suspicious transaction patterns.

•  Bank regulators should ensure that bank staff follow KYC procedures,

review customer files and a sampling of accounts, and emphasize that

they will take appropriate action against officers who fail to follow KYC

procedures.

Customer identification is an essential element of an effective CDD program,

which banks need in order to guard against reputational, operational, legal,

and concentration risks. It is also necessary to comply with AML legal

requirements and identify bank accounts related to terrorism. In February

2003, the Committee issued account opening and customer identification

guidelines and a general guide to good practices based on the principles of

the Committee’s paper, Customer Due Diligence for Banks. This document,

which was developed by the working group on cross-border banking, does

not cover every eventuality; rather, it focuses on some of the mechanisms
that banks can use to develop an effective customer identification program.

The need for rigorous CDD standards is not restricted to banks. The Basel

Committee recommends that similar guidance be developed for all nonbank

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 179

Version 6.44

financial organizations and professional intermediaries of financial services,

such as lawyers and accountants.

In October 2004, the Committee released another important publication on

KYC, Consolidated KYC Risk Management, as a complement to its Customer
Due Diligence for Banks issued in October 2001. The 2004 paper examines the

critical elements of effective management of KYC risk throughout a banking

group and addresses the need for banks to adopt a global approach and
apply the elements necessary for a sound KYC program to both the parent

bank or head office and all of its branches and subsidiaries. These elements

consist of risk management, customer acceptance and identification policies,
and ongoing monitoring of high-risk accounts.

Recent guidance

In January 2014, the Basel Committee issued guidelines on Sound

Management of Risks Related to Money Laundering and Financing of

Terrorism that superseded previous publications on customer due diligence

for banks and know-your-customer risk management. The goal of the

guidelines was to support banking supervisors and banks in the

implementation of the FATF Recommendations concerning AML/CFT within

the wider context of banking supervision standards, drawing from the

expertise of both organizations and working to avoid duplication.

The guidelines on management of risks related to money laundering and the

financing of terrorism describe how banks should include these risks within

their overall risk management framework. The guidelines state that prudent

management of these risks, together with effective supervisory oversight, is

critical in protecting the safety and soundness of banks and the integrity of

the financial system. Failure to manage these risks can expose banks to

serious reputational, operational and compliance risks among others.

The guidelines discuss the following controls for banks to implement:

•  Risk analysis and governance: The first step in managing money laundering

risks is to identify and analyze them, which leads to the design and

effective implementation of appropriate controls. The analysis should

include appropriate inherent and residual risks at the country, sector, bank,

and business relationship levels, among others. The assessment of risk
should be documented and made available to authorities, such as

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 180

Version 6.44

supervisors. This assessment is also useful in scheduling discussions with

other parties in the bank to help them see the risks and design the
appropriate controls to mitigate them.

•  Proper governance arrangements create a culture of compliance, with a

strong compliance tone from the top. The board of directors plays a critical

oversight role; as the senior-most management of the bank, the board

should approve and oversee policies for risk, risk management, and
compliance. To make informed decisions, the board also should have a

clear understanding of the money laundering risks, including timely,

complete, and accurate information related to the risk assessment. Along
with senior management, the board should appoint a qualified chief AML

officer with overall responsibility for the AML function. The board should
provide this senior-level officer with sufficient authority so that, when

issues are raised, they get the appropriate attention from the board, senior

management, and business lines. This AML officer becomes the board’s

proxy for driving the day-to-day success of the bank’s AML efforts. As

such, the board should provide the AML officer with sufficient resources to

execute his responsibilities to oversee compliance with the bank’s AML

program.

•  Three lines of defense: The Committee describes three lines of defense in a
bank’s AML efforts: the line of business, compliance and internal control

functions, and internal audit.

1.  The line of business, or the first line of defense, is responsible for

creating, implementing, and maintaining policies and procedures, as

well as communicating them to all personnel. It must also establish

processes for screening employees to ensure high ethical and

professional standards. It must deliver appropriate training on AML

policies and procedures based on roles and functions performed so

employees are aware of their responsibilities. To facilitate this,

employees should be trained as soon as possible after being hired, with

refresher training provided as appropriate.

2.  The AML compliance and internal control functions, as well as the larger

compliance function and human resources and technology

departments, comprise the second line of defense. In all cases, the AML

officer is responsible for ongoing monitoring for AML compliance,

including sample testing and review of exception reports, to enable the

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 181

Version 6.44

escalation of identified noncompliance and other issues to senior

management and, when appropriate, the board. The AML officer should
be the contact point for all AML issues for internal and external

authorities and should be responsible for reporting suspicious
transactions. To enable the successful oversight of the AML program,

the AML officer must have sufficient independence from the business

lines to prevent conflicts of interest and unbiased advice and counsel.
The officer should not be entrusted with the responsibilities of data

protection or internal audit.

3.  The audit function, or the third line of defense, should report to the audit
committee of the board of directors (or a similar oversight body) and

independently evaluate the risk management and controls of the bank.
This is accomplished through periodic assessments, including the

adequacy of the bank’s controls to mitigate the identified risks,

effectiveness of the bank’s staff’s execution of the controls,

effectiveness of the compliance oversight and quality controls, and

effectiveness of the training. The audit function must have

knowledgeable employees with sufficient audit expertise. Audits should

be conducted on a risk-based frequency; periodically, an enterprise-

wide audit should be conducted. Audits should be properly scoped to

evaluate the effectiveness of the program, including where external

auditors are used. Auditors should proactively follow up on their findings

and recommendations.

•  Customer due diligence and acceptance: Banks should develop a customer
acceptance policy to identify customers that are likely to pose a higher

money laundering risk (e.g., PEPs) and relationships the bank will not

accept (e.g., shell banks and those prohibited under economic sanctions,

such as those imposed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control). Banks

should apply basic due diligence to all customers and increase the level of

due diligence as the risks increase. Some customers may be eligible for

simplified due diligence when the money laundering risk is low, in

accordance with applicable law.

When collecting information, a third-party database, or “KYC utility,” can be

particularly useful for gathering information on customers, especially

assessing risk indicators. The Committee highlights several factors that

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 182

Version 6.44

banks should consider when using a utility to perform due diligence,

including:

o  The utility specifies the date of the last update and when the

information was last confirmed with the source.

o  The utility clearly specifies the source of the information (e.g., the

customer itself, a public registry).

Banks’ CDD policies should address customer and beneficial owner
identification, verification, and risk profiling. As part of this, banks should

identify customers and verify their identities, as well as those of any

beneficial owners. There are four main steps for verifying customers: (1)
identification of the customer (whether an individual or a legal person) and

any beneficial owners or authorized signatories; (2) assessment of the

customer’s risk profile information; (3) verification of the identity of the

customer and any beneficial owners or authorized signatories, as required

by applicable law, using reliable documentary and/or nondocumentary

sources; and (4) further risk-based verification, such as verifying source of

wealth and source of funds.

The minimum information to be collected on individuals includes the legal

name, residential address, unique identification number or other identifier,

and date and place of birth. Other potential information to be collected,

based on risk, can include other names used, residency status, and

business address. In order to accurately assess customer risk, certain

information should be collected, such as occupation, income, expected

use of the account, and products requested. Banks can use documentary

and nondocumentary means to verify the information provided by the

customer. Documentary methods can include using an unexpired

government-issued photographic identification document or confirming a

residential address on a utility bill or bank statement. Nondocumentary

methods include using public registers, private databases, and other

reliable and independent sources. Finally, further verification should be

performed when a customer is considered high risk, such as verification of

income sources, verification of employment, or a personal reference.

Banks should not establish a relationship or carry out transactions until the

customer’s identity has been verified, unless doing so would interrupt the

normal conduct of business, in which case the bank should develop

appropriate controls while verification and CDD are performed. Verification

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 183

Version 6.44

of identity should be accomplished through reliable means. For beneficial

ownership, banks may use a written declaration from the customer, but
they should not rely solely on such declarations.

When CDD cannot be performed or a customer’s identity cannot be
verified, the bank should not open an account or should close such opened

accounts and consider reporting the activity as suspicious to appropriate

authorities. This applies to anonymous accounts as well; these should not
be opened. If a bank allows for numbered accounts, these should not be

allowed to serve as anonymous accounts; sufficient personnel should have

full access to the information to ensure appropriate CDD on and oversight
over these accounts.

•  Transaction monitoring systems and ongoing monitoring: Because the

transaction monitoring system is key to mitigating money laundering risk

within a bank, the Committee recognizes that AML risks require more than

just appropriate policies and procedures; banks must have adequate and

appropriate monitoring systems. For most banks, this will involve an

automated transaction monitoring system. If the bank does not believe it

needs an automated transaction monitoring system, it should document

the rationale for why it does not need one. The monitoring system should

cover all accounts and transactions of the bank’s customers, enable a

trend analysis of activity, and identify unusual business relationships and

transactions, particularly with regard to changes in the transactional profile

of customers. The transaction monitoring system should allow the bank to

gain a centralized knowledge of information, for example, organized by

customer, by legal entity within a larger group, and/or by business unit.

Although the guidance indicates a bank must have a system, it should be

understood that this does not mean that there can only be one IT tool that

will do all of the monitoring. Rather, the tools must be able to work together

to enable the bank to gain an enterprise-level view of money laundering

risk across the bank.

A critical way to mitigate money laundering risk is to use the transaction

monitoring system to conduct ongoing monitoring of customer activity,

building on the information from risk assessments and customer profiles.

This enables banks to satisfy their obligation to identify and report

suspicious activity. Monitoring systems should be adapted to the risks

present in the bank, such as if the bank identifies a particular money
laundering typology occurring within its jurisdiction.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 184

Version 6.44

•  Management of information: Because one of the primary purposes of AML
rules is to create records that enable law enforcement to trace financial
transactions back to the people who conduct them, banks should retain

records. Banks should record the documents they are provided when
verifying customer and beneficial ownership identity, whether a

photocopy of the document or information from a nondocumentary

source, and enter all CDD information into their IT systems. The CDD
information should be kept up-to-date and accurate, which will mean

periodically assessing the information, generally on a risk-based frequency.

Banks should also document decisions related to investigations of unusual
activity, whether or not a decision is made to file a SAR. Banks should

maintain all of these records, as required by law, for at least five years after
closing the account. If an ongoing investigation is occurring, relevant CDD

records should not be destroyed merely because the record retention

period has expired.

•  Reporting of suspicious transactions and asset freezing: Ongoing

monitoring of accounts and transactions enables banks to identify unusual

activity, refer unusual activity to an internal review function, eliminate false-

positive alerts, and report suspicious activity in a timely and confidential

manner. This process should be clearly described in policies and

procedures and communicated to appropriate staff.

When suspicious activity has been reported, the bank should take

appropriate action regarding the customer, including raising the risk rating

of the customer and/or deciding whether to retain the relationship (either

the account or the entire relationship). In some cases, it might be

appropriate to close out one account, but not the whole relationship, such

as when a customer has both a checking account and an outstanding loan.

Banks should screen new customers against applicable sanctions lists and

the existing portfolio against changes to the sanctions list to identify

relationships that may need to be frozen. Banks should have a means of

properly freezing any assets identified as part of this process.

The guidelines have been updated since their publication in 2014. In 2020,

new text was added that set out specific principles and examples of

effective cooperation between prudential and AML/CFT supervisors. In

many jurisdictions, prudential and AML/CFT supervision are handled by

different authorities. For example, in the United Kingdom, prudential

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 185

Version 6.44

supervision is performed by the Prudential Regulation Authority, while

AML/CFT supervision is performed by the Financial Conduct Authority. This
situation can make cooperation on ongoing supervision and enforcement

difficult to maintain. The 2020 update directly addresses this concern by
sharing mechanisms on facilitating better cooperation at the domestic and

international levels.

European Union Directives on

Money Laundering

The European Union AML Directives are issued periodically by the European

Parliament and implemented by member states as part of domestic

legislation. The Directives are intended to prevent money laundering and
terrorist financing and establish a consistent regulatory environment across

the European Union, while allowing some flexibility based on local law. This is
done by addressing the emerging money laundering and terrorist financing

typologies, helping to close AML compliance gaps.

First Directive

The EU’s First Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, On

Prevention of the Use of the Financial System for the Purpose of Money

Laundering (91/308/EEC), was adopted by the Council of the European

Communities in June 1991.

Like all directives adopted by the Council, it required member states to

achieve the specified results, by amending national law, if necessary. This First

Directive required members to enact legislation to prevent their domestic
financial systems from being used for money laundering.

The unique nature of the EU as a community of states makes it fundamentally

different from other international organizations. The EU can adopt measures

that have the force of law even without the approval of the national

parliaments of the various member states. In addition, European law prevails

over national law in the case of directives. In this respect, EU directives have

far more weight than the voluntary standards issued by groups such as the

Basel Committee and FATF. Of course, the Directives apply only to EU
member states and not to other countries.

The First Directive confined predicate offenses of money laundering to drug

trafficking, as defined in the 1988 Vienna Convention. However, member

states were encouraged to extend the predicate offenses to other crimes.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 187

Version 6.44

Second Directive

In December 2001, the EU agreed on a Second Directive (2001/97/EEC),

which amended the First Directive to require stricter money laundering
controls across the continent.

Member states agreed to implement it as national law by June 15, 2003;

however, only Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland met the
deadline, with Ireland and Spain complying shortly afterward. Other member

states eventually followed.

The following were the key features of the Second Directive:

•

•

•

•

It extended the scope of the First Directive beyond drug-related crimes.

The definition of criminal activity was expanded to cover not just drug

trafficking, but all serious crimes, including corruption and fraud against the

financial interests of the European community.

It explicitly brought currency exchanges and money remittance offices

under AML coverage.

It clarified that knowledge of criminal conduct can be inferred from

objective factual circumstances.

It provided a more precise definition of money laundering to include:

o  The conversion or transfer of property with knowledge that it is derived

from criminal activity or from participation in that activity, for the

purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property, or

assisting anyone who is involved in the commission of the activity to

evade the legal consequences of his action

o  Concealing or disguising the nature, source, location, disposition,
movement, and rights with respect to or ownership of property,

knowing that the property is derived from criminal activity or from an

act of participation in that activity

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 188

Version 6.44

o  The acquisition, possession, or use of property, knowing when it is
received that it was derived from criminal activity or from an act of
participation in the activity

o  Participation in, association to commit, the attempt to commit, and

aiding, abetting, facilitating, or counseling the commission of any of the

mentioned actions

•

It widened the businesses and professions that are subject to the
obligations of the Directive. Certain persons, including lawyers when they

participate in the movement of money for clients, were required to report

to authorities any fact that might indicate money laundering. Covered
groups included auditors, external accountants, tax advisors, real estate

agents, notaries, and legal professionals.

The Second Directive was a significant step forward because its applicability

included many of the important financial centers of the world. It went well

beyond similar standards issued by other organizations, such as the United
Nations and even FATF.

Third Directive

A Third EU Directive, 2005/60/EC, On the Prevention of the Use of the

Financial System for the Purposes of Money Laundering and Terrorist

Financing, based on elements of FATF’s revised 40 Recommendations, was

adopted in 2005.

The EU expected the Third Directive to be implemented by member states by

December 15, 2007. Although several countries did not meet this original

deadline, the Directive was eventually implemented by all members.

In line with FATF’s AML recommendations, the Third Directive extended the

scope of the First and Second Directives by:

•  Defining money laundering and terrorist financing as separate crimes. The
Directive’s measures were expanded to cover not only the manipulation of

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 189

Version 6.44

money derived from crime, but also the collection of money and property

for terrorist purposes.

•  Extending customer identification and SAR reporting obligations to trusts
and company service providers, life insurance intermediaries, and dealers
selling goods for cash payments of more than €15,000

•  Detailing a risk-based approach to CDD. The extent of due diligence that is
performed on customers, whether simplified or enhanced, should be
dependent on their AML/CFT risk.

•  Protecting employees who report suspicions of money laundering or

terrorist financing. This provision instructs member states to “do whatever
is in their power to prevent employees from being threatened.”

•  Obligating member states to keep comprehensive statistics regarding the
use of and results obtained from SARs, such as the number of reports filed,

the follow-up given to those reports, and the annual number of cases

investigated, persons prosecuted, and persons convicted

•  Requiring all financial institutions to identify and verify (ID&V) the beneficial
owner of all accounts held by legal entities or persons. “Beneficial owner”

refers to the natural person who directly or indirectly controls more than 25

percent of a legal entity or person.

The Third Directive applies to:

•  Credit institutions

•  Financial institutions

•  Auditors, external accountants, and tax advisors

•  Legal professionals

•  Trust and company service providers

•  Estate agents

o  High-value goods dealers who trade in cash over €15,000 euros

•  Casinos

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 190

Version 6.44

The scope of the Third Directive differs from the Second Directive in that:

•

•

•

It specifically includes the category of trust and company service
providers.

It covers all dealers trading in goods who trade in cash over €15,000.

It expands the definition of financial institution to include certain insurance

intermediaries.

There were three main points of contention regarding the Third Directive:

1.  The definition of PEPs: The Third Directive defined PEPs as “natural persons
who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions and the

immediate family members, or individuals known to be close associates, of
such persons.” Close associates must be identified only when their

relationship with a PEP is publicly known or when the institution suspects

there is a relationship. Finally, the Commission stipulated that persons

should not be considered PEPs after one year of not being in a prominent

position.

2.  The Directive included lawyers among those professionals who are

required to report suspicious activity.

3.  The precise role of a comitology committee: The European Commission
coined the term “comitology,” which means the EU system that oversees

the implementation of acts proposed by the European Commission.

Fourth Directive

Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20

May 2015 On the Prevention of the Use of the Financial System for the

Purposes of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing took effect on June 26,

2015. Member states had two years from that date to adapt their national

legislations accordingly. This Directive repealed the Third Directive and its

predecessors.

Differences between the Fourth Directive and its predecessors include the

following:

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 191

Version 6.44

•  Natural and legal persons trading in goods are covered to the extent that

they make or receive cash payments of €10,000 or more (decreased from
€15,000).

•  The scope of obliged entities was enlarged from just casinos to all

“providers of gambling services.”

•  CDD should be applied for transfers of funds exceeding €1,000. New

definitions for:

o  Correspondent relationship
o  PEPs’ family members and persons known to be close associates
o  Senior management and others

•  Tax crimes relating to direct and indirect taxes are included in the broad

definition of criminal activity, in line with the revised FATF

Recommendations.

•  An explanation of “financial activity on an occasional or very limited basis”

was included.

•  The European Commission must submit a report every two years on the

findings of the risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing

affecting the internal market.

•  The EU executive is also in charge of identifying third-country jurisdictions
that have strategic deficiencies with regard to AML and CFT (i.e., high-risk

third countries).

•  Special attention is given to PEPs. In this regard, EDD should be applied to
every PEP, whether the individual is a domestic or third-country citizen.

The risk these people pose is for at least 12 months, and measures they are

subject to must also be applied to their family members and their known

close associates.

•  For groups (and their branches and subsidiaries), this Directive sets the

criteria for adequate compliance related to CDD of third parties.

•  New requirements regarding beneficial ownership information were

introduced, particularly for trusts and similar legal arrangements. Subject to

data protection rules, this information must be held in central registers in

each member state and must be made available to competent authorities,

FIUs, obliged entities, and any person with legitimate interest.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 192

Version 6.44

•  Data in the statistics relevant to the effectiveness of systems to combat
money laundering and terrorist financing were enlarged to include, for
example, size and importance of sectors and the number of cross-border

requests for information managed by FIUs.

•  Obliged entities that are part of a group are required to implement group-
wide policies and procedures and take measures proportionate to their

risks. Criminals and their associates who are convicted in relevant areas are
prevented from holding management functions and indirectly controlling

certain obliged entities.

•  With regard to penalties for breach of the provisions, the set of

administrative sanctions and measures now ranges from “name and

shame” to withdrawal of authorization. Pecuniary sanctions for natural

persons are set to at least €5 million or 10 percent of the total annual

turnover for entities.

•  An entire section of the Directive is dedicated to the rules for cooperation

between member state FIUs, the European Supervisory Authorities and the

EU Commission.

•  Because it is a directive and not a regulation, this legislative act gives some

discretion to member states on the application of its provisions.

•  At the national level, the Directive requests that member states conduct an
AML/CFT risk assessment and designate a responsible authority. Moreover,

they must ensure that obliged entities take appropriate steps to identify

and assess their own risks. Nonexhaustive lists of potentially lower and

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

higher risks are provided for guidance in these risk assessments and are

based on:

o  Customer risk factors, such as public administrations versus cash-

intensive businesses

o  Risk factors related to products and services, transaction, and delivery
channels, such as low premium insurance policies versus private

banking

o  Geographical risk factors, such as member states versus countries

subject to sanctions.

Fifth Directive

Directive (EU) 2018/843 On the Prevention of the Use of the Financial System

for the Purposes of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing was put in

place on July 9, 2018. The Fifth Directive further strengthens the EU’s AML and

CFT regime. It focuses on seven areas:

•  Beneficial Owners: The Fifth Directive requires that national registers of

beneficial ownership (excluding trusts) be publicly accessible. Regulated

entities are required to provide “adequate, accurate, and up-to-date”

information on their beneficial owners.

•  Cooperation and information sharing between regulators: The Fifth Directive

strengthens the cooperation and information sharing among financial

supervisors across EU members.

•  High-risk third countries: Additional monitoring on high-risk third countries

is based on:

o  Countries on the FATF list and on the EU list
o  Autonomous assessment of additional countries that identifies the risk

profile and level of threat to which each country is exposed and

assesses the legal framework and its effective application in eight areas:

1.  Criminalization of money laundering and terrorism financing

2.  Customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, record keeping, and

reporting suspicious transactions

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 194

Version 6.44

3.  Designated nonfinancial businesses and professions have the same

CDD, record keeping, and reporting obligations.

4.  Sanctions should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

5.  Countries must ensure effective supervision.

6.  International cooperation

7.  Information about the beneficial owners of a legal entity and legal

arrangements must be available.

8.  Implement targeted financial sanctions (UN) to suppress terrorism.

The Fifth Directive added a streamlined EDD approach when

transacting with high-risk countries, including:

o  Collecting additional information on the customer, the beneficial owner
and the nature of the business relationship, including source of funds

and source of wealth

o  Obtaining approval of senior management for business relationships
o  Enhancing the monitoring of those entities, including obtaining

information on the reasons for the intended or performed transactions

•  Prepaid Cards: The Fifth Directive lowers the threshold when prepaid cards

may be used anonymously to €150 from €250 when making in-store

purchases and €50 when making purchases online.

•  Enhanced identification of PEPs: The Fifth Directive introduces more
efficient ways to identify PEPs by publishing a list of prominent PEPs

gathered from each member state and accredited international

organizations.

•  Extended scope of sectors and persons subject to AML/CFT obligations: The

Fifth Directive extends applicability of prior directives to the following

sectors and persons:

o  Estate agents
o  Auditors, external accountants, and tax advisors
o  Art traders
o  Custodian wallet providers

•  Exchangers between virtual currencies (e.g., cryptocurrencies) and fiat
currencies will be required to have AML/CFT controls and need to be

licensed or registered, while being supervised and monitored by relevant

authorities. Virtual-to-virtual currency exchanges do not fall under this
supervision.

Sixth Directive

Directive (EU) 2018/1673 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23

October 2018 On the Prevention of the Use of the Financial System for the
Purposes of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing became effective on

December 3, 2020. Regulated entities operating in the European Union
are required to be compliant by June 3, 2021. This Directive repealed the Fifth

Directive and its predecessors.

The main purpose of the Sixth Directive is to create a better consistency on

predicate offenses throughout the EU member states. The Directive includes

the following changes:

•  Harmonization of predicate offences against money laundering in all

member states. The list consists of 22 predicate offences.

•  Expanded regulatory scope by the introduction of “aiding and abetting,”

“inciting,” and “attempting” as offences. This means that accomplices can

face the same penalties as the individuals who profit directly from financial

crimes.

•  Criminal liability is extended to legal persons. In this manner, companies
can be criminally liable for the actions of employees who engage in

criminal activities.

•  Tougher punishments for financial crime offenders, with the minimum jail
sentence increasing from one year to four years. Legal entities will also

face tougher sanctions in the form of exclusion, permanent or temporary

disqualification or closure, and placement under juridical supervision.

•  Enhancement of cooperation and harmonization among member

states addresses the issue of dual criminality, requiring member states to

criminalize certain predicate offences.

By harmonizing the predicate offences, there are no differences between
how member states consider certain crimes. This eliminates the possibility

that some member states would have laws that punish a specific crime,

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 196

Version 6.44

whereas other states would not punish the same crime. It creates equality

and clarity, reducing the ability of criminals to pick the legislation within the
EU that fits them best.

The Sixth AML Directive further intensifies the fight against financial crime
by stating that people who have willfully cooperated in a crime (vs. those

who execute a crime) are also punishable by law. Simply said, when

individuals are in some way involved in a financial crime, such as money
laundering or terrorist financing, either by assisting or willfully ignoring it,

they can still be prosecuted and face a jail sentence (of four years instead

of one). Being involved in a financial crime can result in sentences for the
involved individuals within an organization and enforcement actions

against the organization as well. If an organization in part or as a whole aids
financial criminals, the organization could be suspended or barred from

certain activities. It is also possible that the organization could be put under

supervision or even liquidated.

Seventh Directive

In July 2021, the EU Commission published a package of legislative proposals

to further strengthen AML/CFT rules in the EU. This package might later be

translated into the Seventh Directive. The aim of the proposals is to improve

the detection of suspicious transactions and activities and close loopholes

used by criminals to launder illicit proceeds and finance terrorist activities

through the financial system. The package presents the following proposals:

•

Introduction of the EU centralized system of bank account registries: This
registry will provide access to banking information without further

authorizations or delays. The aim is to have a single, centralized access

point for all national centralized bank account registries. It will allow

enforcement authorities in every EU state to get immediate information

about bank accounts opened in the European banks, as well as their

beneficiaries.

•

Introduction of EU Central AML Authority (AMLA): The proposals create a
new EU authority that will transform AML/CFT supervision in the EU and

enhance cooperation among FIUs. It will be the central authority,

coordinating national authorities to ensure the private sector correctly and

consistently applies EU rules. The expectation is that AMLA

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 197

Version 6.44

will be operational by 2024 and begin the work of direct supervision when

the Directive has been transposed and new rules are effectuated.

•  Unification of AML/KYC rules in member states: The European Commission
wants EU member states to implement AML Directives much more quickly
and have a “level playing field” (i.e., the same rules, documentation, and

wording) for all member states. The European Commission thus intends to

pass a regulation regarding unification of AML and KYC rules with direct
effect (i.e., it is not necessary to further implement the rules into the

national laws).

•  Extending the scope of crypto business models toward AML

requirements: Virtual asset transfers are subject to similar AML/CFT
requirements as wire funds transfers.

•

Implementation of “Crypto Travel Rule”: Based on the FATF’s modified
Recommendation 16, also called the travel rule guideline, which is a guard

against money laundering and other financial crimes, a “Crypto Travel Rule”

is proposed. The new crypto travel rule guidance recommends that VASPs,

including exchanges, banks, over-the-counter desks, hosted wallets, and

other financial organizations, share certain identifying information about

the recipient and receiver for cryptocurrency transactions higher than

US$/€1,000 globally.

•  Prohibition of anonymous crypto wallets: Anonymous crypto wallets are no

longer allowed.

•  Prohibition of cash purchases over €10,000: The new regulation will contain

directly applicable rules, including in the areas of CDD and beneficial

ownership. It also includes establishment of an EU-wide limit of €10,000 for

cash payments.

The EU Commission’s AML package reflects its concern about the failure of

some member states to enforce certain legislation and the delays

in implementation of national laws. The goals of the AML package are to

tighten cooperation, create a level playing field, and enable faster

implementation of new AML Directives, without needing to fortify it in national

law. The new European Union AML/CFT laws supersede local/national laws of

its member states.

For this reason, regulated entities should closely follow new regulations; the
time to implement them into an organization’s policies, procedures, and

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 198

Version 6.44

systems could be reduced. For regulated entities across multiple EU member

states, the proposed package might increase efficiency, as legislation and its
AML and KYC requirements will be consistent in all states.

Another significant change is that the EU centralized system of bank account
registries will greatly enhance the ability of regulated entities to validate newly

onboarded customers and any counterparties in transactions. With this ability

also comes great responsibility; when the information is so readily available,
regulators will expect organizations to take these extra steps as a minimum.

Not long after the Sixth AML Directive came out, there was criticism regarding

the loopholes still existing for crypto transactions and virtual assets.
The gaps and deficiencies identified by, for example, FATF, the European

Securities and Markets Authority, and the European Banking Authority, have

been closed. Therefore, financial organizations that do anything with crypto

must implement several additional steps to ensure they are compliant. One

area of money laundering concern is the virtual assets space that is becoming

increasing larger (in volume and capital size) and showing similar patterns as

money laundering in the art and real estate sectors.

FATF-Style Regional Bodies

FATF-Style Regional Bodies and FATF and
Associate Members

There are nine FSRBs, which have similar forms and functions to that of FATF.

They are also considered FATF associate members. In setting standards, FATF
depends on input from the FSRBs as much as from its own members;

however, FATF remains the only standard-setting body.

The following high-level principles apply to both FATF and FSRBs:

•  Role: Both FATF and FSRBs help jurisdictions implement FATF standards.
FSRBs play an essential role in identifying and addressing whatever

AML/CFT technical assistance their individual members might need. FSRBs

that coordinate technical assistance for their members also offer mutual

evaluation and follow-up processes.

•  Autonomy: FATF and FSRBs are free-standing organizations that share the
common goals of combating money laundering and the financing of

terrorism and proliferation, as well as fostering effective AML/CFT systems.

•  Sharing common objectives and working in partnership: Despite the

autonomy of FATF and the individual FSRBs, they share a common goal in

combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism and

proliferation, fostering effective AML/CFT systems, and identifying and

addressing threats to the financial system.

•  Reciprocity: FATF and FSRBs operate on the basis of (mutual, joint, or

common) recognition of their work, which implies that FSRBs and FATF put

in place similar mechanisms for effective participation and involvement in

one another’s’ activities.

•  Common interest: Because FATF and FSRBs are part of a larger whole, and
the success or failure of one organization can affect all organizations,

protection of the FATF brand is in the common interest of both FATF and

FSRBs.

Many FATF member countries are also members of the nine FSRBs:

•  Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG)

•  Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF)

•  Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering

Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL, formerly PC-R-EV)

•  Eurasian Group (EAG)

•  Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG)

•  Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (GAFILAT) (formerly known as

Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering in South America

(GAFISUD)

•

Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West

Africa (GIABA)

•  Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF)

•  Task Force on Money Laundering in Central Africa (GABAC)

Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering
(APG)

The APG, an autonomous regional AML body, was established in February 1997

at the Fourth Asia/Pacific Money Laundering Symposium in Bangkok, where it
adopted its Terms of Reference.

The Terms of Reference were substantially revised in July 2012 to recognize

that the FATF’s revised 40 Recommendations constituted the new

international standards on combating money laundering and the financing of

terrorism and proliferation. The Terms included a commitment that APG

members would implement these recommendations according to their

specific cultural values and constitutional frameworks. It also stipulated that, to

ensure a global approach, members of the APG would work closely with FATF.

The APG uses similar mechanisms as FATF to monitor and facilitate progress.

The APG and FATF have reciprocal rights of attendance at each other’s
meetings, as well as reciprocal sharing of documents. However, the APG, as

with other autonomous AML bodies, determines its own policies and

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 201

Version 6.44

practices. It is not a precondition for participation in the APG that AML/CFT

laws already be enacted.

The APG:

•  Provides a focus for cooperative AML/CFT efforts in the Asia/Pacific region

•  Provides a forum in which regional issues can be discussed and

experiences shared, and operational cooperation among member

jurisdictions is encouraged

•  Facilitates the adoption and implementation by member jurisdictions of

internationally accepted AML/CFT measures

•  Enables regional and jurisdictional factors to be taken into account in the

implementation of international AML/CFT measures

•  Encourages jurisdictions to implement AML/CFT initiatives, including more

effective mutual legal assistance

•  Coordinates and provides practical support, when possible, to member

and observer jurisdictions in the region, when requested

The APG is voluntary and cooperative in nature. The work done by the APG

and its procedures are decided by mutual agreement among its members.

The group was established by agreement among its members and is

autonomous; it is not derived from an international treaty and is not part of any

international organization.

The APG continues to grow. APG members include Afghanistan, Australia,

Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Kingdom of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Canada,

China, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Hong Kong SAR (China), India, Indonesia, the

Republic of Korea (South Korea), Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,

Macao SAR (China), Malaysia, Maldives, The Republic of the Marshall Islands,

Mongolia, Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, New Zealand, Niue, Pakistan, Palau, Papua

New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka,

Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Timor Leste, Tonga, United States of America,
Vanuatu, and Vietnam.

The APG Secretariat is headquartered in Sydney, Australia.

Caribbean Financial Action Task Force
(CFATF)

Given its proximity to the world’s largest cocaine producers and exporters in

South America’s Andean region and one of the largest drug markets (the US),

the Caribbean basin has long been a convenient banking center for many
international criminals, including drug traffickers.

The group consists of 27 states in the Caribbean Basin and Central and South
America that have agreed to implement common countermeasures to

address the problems of money laundering, terrorist financing, and the

financing of the WMD proliferation. It was established as the result of meetings
convened in Aruba in May 1990 and Jamaica in November 1992.

The main objective of the CFATF is to achieve effective implementation of

and compliance with its recommendations to prevent and control money

laundering and combat the financing of terrorism. The Secretariat has been

established as a mechanism to monitor and encourage progress to ensure full
implementation of the Kingston Ministerial Declaration (see below).

In May 1990, representatives of Western Hemisphere countries, in particular

from the Caribbean and from Central America, convened in Aruba to develop

a common approach to the phenomenon of money laundering. Nineteen

recommendations constituting this common approach were formulated.

These recommendations, which had specific relevance to the region,
complemented the FATF’s 40 Recommendations.

The Jamaica Ministerial Meeting was held in Kingston in November 1992.

Ministers issued the Kingston Ministerial Declaration, in which they endorsed

and affirmed their governments’ commitment to implement the FATF and

Aruba Recommendations, the Organization of American States (OAS) Model

Regulations, and the 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs

and Psychotropic Substances. They also mandated the establishment of the

Secretariat to coordinate the implementation of these recommendations by

CFATF member countries.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 203

Version 6.44

The Declaration recommended laws:

•  Defining money laundering based on the model laws issued by the OAS

•  Concerning the seizure and forfeiture of drug proceeds and linked assets

that enable the identification, tracing, and evaluation of property subject to
seizure and that permit freezing orders

•  Allowing judicial challenges to seizure orders by an administrative body

•  Permitting forfeiture in all cases following conviction

•  Permitting courts to decide that “all property obtained during a prescribed
period of time by a person convicted of drug trafficking has been derived

from such criminal activity”

The Caribbean nations agreed to enter into mutual assistance agreements

with one another to assist in money laundering investigations. They also

agreed that money laundering should be an extraditable offense subject to

simplified procedures and forfeited assets should be shared among

cooperating nations.

CFATF members include Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, The Bahamas,

Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Curaçao, Dominica, El Salvador,

Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia,

Saint Maarten, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and

Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Venezuela, and Virgin Islands.

The CFATF monitors members’ implementation of the anti-money laundering

recommendations. The CFATF Secretariat is hosted by the Government of

Trinidad and Tobago in the Port of Spain.

Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of
Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the
Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL)

In September 1997, MONEYVAL was established by the Committee of

Ministers of the Council of Europe to conduct self- and mutual-assessment

exercises of the AML measures in place in Council of Europe member states
that were not members of FATF. MONEYVAL became an associate member

of FATF in 2006.

On October 13, 2010, the Committee of Ministers adopted the Resolution
CM/Res(2010)12 on the Statute of the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation

of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism

(MONEYVAL). The statute elevated MONEYVAL to an independent monitoring

mechanism within the Council of Europe, answerable directly to the

Committee of Ministers on January 1, 2011. The MONEYVAL Statute was further
amended in 2013 by the Resolution CM/ Res(2013)13.

MONEYVAL members include: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia

Financial Action Task Force of Latin America
(GAFILAT)

The Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (GAFILAT), formerly known

as Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering in South America

(GAFISUD), was created in December 2000 in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia,
when a memorandum of understanding was signed by government

representatives from nine countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Since then, several other countries

have joined as full members of the task force, including Mexico (2006), Costa

Rica and Panama (2010), Cuba (2012), Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua
(2013), and the Dominican Republic (2016).

GAFILAT was created in the style of FATF and accepts its 40

Recommendations as the international standard against money laundering

and terrorist financing. It also develops enhanced recommendations to

improve national policies against those crimes.

GAFILAT supports its members in the implementation of the 40

Recommendations as national legislation and the creation of a regional

prevention system against money laundering and terrorist financing. The two
main tools are training measures and mutual evaluations.

GAFILAT members include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa

Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.

GAFILAT has legal capacity and diplomatic status in the Argentine Republic
where its Secretariat is located in Buenos Aires.

At an inaugural ministerial meeting held in Manama, Bahrain, in November

2004, the governments of 14 countries decided to establish a FATF-style

regional body for the Middle East and North Africa. The MENAFATF is voluntary

in nature and was established by agreement among its members. It is not

derived from an international treaty. It is independent of any other

international organization and establishes its own work, rules, and procedures,

which are determined by consensus of its members. It cooperates with other

international bodies, notably FATF, to achieve its objectives.

terrorist activities

Region-specific projects and studies are also undertaken by the ESAAMLG.

For example, a project was initiated in 2014 to obtain information, statistics,

and trends related to wildlife poaching, illegal trade in wildlife products, and

associated money laundering. Building from these efforts, further study of

money laundering and the illegal wildlife trade has been published by FATF,

including red flags such as transfers between shell companies and wildlife
organizations and corruption of PEPs.

Other Influencing Bodies

Organization of American States: Inter-
American Drug Abuse Control Commission

In May 1992, the OAS became the first permanent international body to reach

an agreement on model legislation aimed specifically at dealing with money
laundering. At its annual general assembly held in Nassau, the Bahamas, the

OAS unanimously approved a set of 19 articles written in statutory language

that it recommended its member nations enact.

The OAS action was the culmination of a two-year effort by the Inter-

American Drug Abuse Control Commission, an OAS entity that uses the

acronym CICAD (Comisión Interamericana para el Control del Abuso de

Drogas). In 1990, CICAD gathered a group of experts from 14 nations to craft

the articles.

CICAD’s role includes:

•  Serving as the Western Hemisphere’s policy forum on all aspects of the

illegal drug trade

•  Fostering multilateral cooperation on drug issues in the Americas

•  Executing action programs to strengthen the capacity of member states

to prevent and treat drug abuse, combat production and trafficking of illicit

drugs, and deny traffickers the proceeds of crime

•  Promoting drug-related research, information exchange, specialized

training, and technical assistance

•  Developing and recommending minimum standards for drug-related

legislation, treatment, measurement of both drug consumption and the

cost of drugs to society, and drug-control measures, among others

•  Conducting regular multilateral evaluations of progress by member states

in all aspects of illegal drug trade

production, trafficking, and use of illegal drugs in the Americas. It also aims to

address the health, social, and criminal repercussions of the drug trade.

Within CICAD is an Anti-Money Laundering Unit (CICAD-AMLU), which was

established in 1999. The Unit focuses its efforts on providing technical
assistance and training to all member states in judicial and financial measures

and law enforcement. It also acts as Secretariat of CICAD’s Group of Experts

for the Control of Money Laundering.

Through the Group of Experts, Model Regulations are developed on money

laundering offenses related to drug trafficking and other crimes, including the

financing of terrorism. These regulations serve as permanent legal
documents that provide a legal framework to member states. They were

influenced by and are compatible with FATF’s 40 Recommendations.

The entire set of Model Regulations is available at the CICAD website.

In 1999, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and CICAD started a

program in eight South American countries to train employees from financial

organizations and financial regulatory agencies who are responsible for

enforcing AML requirements. In 2001, another program was developed and

conducted for judges and prosecutors within the eight countries, and, in 2002,

a long-term project was begun to establish financial intelligence units in

Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units

In 1995, several national FIUs began working together in an informal

organization known as the Egmont Group (named for the location of the first

meeting, the Egmont-Arenberg Palace in Brussels). The goal of the group is to

provide a forum for FIUs around the world to improve cooperation and

establish the environment needed to foster trust among countries to securely

share sensitive information in the fight against money laundering and the
financing of terrorism.

The support provided by the Egmont Group includes:

•  Serving as the operational arm of the international AML/CFT apparatus

•  Providing a platform for the secure exchange of expertise and financial

intelligence to combat AML/CFT

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 213

Version 6.44

•  Expanding and systematizing cooperation in the reciprocal exchange of

information

•

Increasing the effectiveness of FIUs by offering training and promoting

personnel exchanges to improve the expertise and capabilities of
personnel employed by FIUs

•  Fostering better and secure communication among FIUs through the
application of technology, such as the Egmont Secure Web (ESW)

•  Promoting the operational autonomy of FIUs

•  Promoting the establishment of FIUs in conjunction with jurisdictions with

an AML/CFT program in place or in areas with a program in the early stages
of development

The Egmont Group comprises several organizational groups, including the

Heads of FIUs, the Egmont Committee, the Working Groups, the Regional

Groups, and the Egmont Group Secretariat. The five working groups that

meet periodically and report to the Heads of FIUs include the IT Working

Group, Legal Working Group, Operational Working Group, Outreach Working

Group, and Training Working Group.

In 2013, the Egmont Group produced a revised set of governing documents to

lay the foundation for the future work of the Egmont Group and contribute to

greater international cooperation and information exchange among FIUs.

These documents include The Egmont Charter and the Egmont Principles for

Information Exchange and Operational Guidance for FIUs. The latter

document is binding for members and includes several provisions, including

General Framework and International Co-operation requirements. Examples

of the provisions include:

•  The Egmont Group fosters the development of FIUs and information

exchange.

•

•

International cooperation among FIUs should be encouraged and based

upon a foundation of mutual trust.

Information-sharing arrangements must recognize and allow room for

case-by-case solutions to specific problems.

•  FIUs should exchange information with foreign FIUs, regardless of their

status (i.e., administrative, law enforcement, judicial, or other).

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 214

Version 6.44

•  FIUs should use the most efficient means to cooperate.

•  Exchanged information should be used only for the purpose for which the

information was sought or provided.

Resources provided by the Egmont Group include case studies related to
money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other forms of financial

crimes. These case studies often consist of information compiled by

reviewing cases submitted by FIUs from various jurisdictions. They can be
used to assist AML professionals in identifying suspicious activity and

determining whether to report these activities.

In 1999, the Training Working Group undertook an initiative that resulted in the
publication of FIUs in Action: 100 Cases from the Egmont Group. According to

the Egmont Group, this publication has provided invaluable assistance in

identifying the components of money laundering cases. Several best

practices from this analysis can benefit FIUs. Examples include: Disclosures of

suspicious activity by financial organizations should continue to be made, even

while an investigation is being conducted by an FIU, and additional information

obtained by a financial organization’s own inquiries have been shown in a

number of cases to be very useful for later investigations by the authorities.

Beyond the analysis of the 100 cases, the report identifies six of the most

frequently observed indicators of money laundering:

•  Large-scale cash transactions

•  Atypical and uneconomical fund transfers to or from a foreign jurisdiction

•  Unusual business activities and transactions

•  Large and/or rapid movements of funds

•  Unrealistic wealth compared with client profile

•  Defensive stance to questioning

Egmont membership and observer organizations continue to grow because,

according to the FATF Recommendations, FIUs are expected to apply for
membership.

The World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund

The IMF and the World Bank have supported the efforts of FATF in addressing

the resistance of certain nations to joining the international battle against

money laundering. Since 2001, the two organizations have required countries
that benefit from their financial and structural assistance programs to have

effective money laundering controls.

In the joint policy paper “Enhancing Contributions to Combating Money

Laundering,” the two organizations detailed the steps they would take to

strengthen the global assault on money laundering.

In September 2000, the IMF and World Bank started to fully integrate the

battle against money laundering and other financial crimes into its surveillance

exercises and programs. That month, the International Monetary and Financial

Committee (IMFC), the advisors to the IMF’s board of governors, issued a

communiqué that said it would: (1) “prepare a joint paper with the Bank on

their respective roles in combating money laundering and financial crime, and

in protecting the international financial system,” and (2) “explore incorporating

work on financial abuse, particularly with respect to international efforts to

fight against money laundering, into its various activities, as relevant and

appropriate.”

In February 2001, the IMFC, along with the IMF and World Bank, issued the

background paper “Financial System Abuse, Financial Crime, and Money

Laundering,” which explores how the organizations could “play…role[s] in

protecting the integrity of the international financial system from abuse”

through use of their influence to promote national anti-corruption programs.

Since then, the IMF and World Bank have become more active in combating

money laundering by:

•  Concentrating on money laundering over other forms of financial abuse

•  Helping to strengthen financial supervision and regulation in countries

•  More closely interacting with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation

and Development and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision

•

Insisting on the application of international AML standards in countries that

request financial assistance

Page 216

In a joint meeting in April 2004, the two bodies agreed to permanently adopt

their pilot program, which assesses a nation’s compliance with international
AML/CFT. The program put an end to FATF’s practice of publicizing

noncooperative countries and territories.

The World Bank and the IMF established a collaborative framework with FATF

for conducting comprehensive assessments using a single global

methodology of countries’ compliance with FATF’s 40 Recommendations.
The assessments are carried out as part of the Financial Sector Assessment

Program and result in a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes

(ROSC). ROSCs summarize the extent to which countries observe 12 areas
and associated standards for the operational work of the IMF and World Bank.

The 12 areas include: accounting, auditing, AML/CFT, banking supervision,
corporate governance, data dissemination, fiscal transparency, insolvency

and creditor rights, insurance supervision, monetary and financial policy

transparency, payments systems, and securities regulation. The ROSCs are

prepared and published at the request of the member country and

summarize a countries’ observance of the standards. They are used to help

sharpen organizations’ policy discussions with national authorities and in the

private sector, including by rating agencies, for risk-assessment purposes.

Updates to the ROSCs are produced regularly, however, new reports are
prepared and published every several years.

In 2002, the World Bank and the IMF developed the Reference Guide to Anti-

Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism in an effort to
provide practical steps for countries implementing AML/CFT regimes in

accordance with international standards. A Second Edition and Supplement

on Special Recommendation IX was published in 2006. The guide describes

the global problem of money laundering and terrorist financing on the

development agendas of individual countries and across regions. It explains

the basic elements required to build an effective AML/CFT legal and

institutional framework and summarizes the role of the World Bank and IMF in

those efforts.

The following table lists the important AML/CFT organizations and documents:

Key US Legislative and Regulatory

Initiatives

This section provides an overview of the principal elements of US laws related

to money laundering and terrorism financing that affect international

transactions and jurisdictions.

USA PATRIOT Act

Motivated by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the urgent need

to decipher and disable mechanisms that finance terrorism, the US Congress

enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate

Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) in

October 2001 to strengthen money laundering laws and the Bank Secrecy Act

(BSA) to levels unseen since the original passage of the BSA in 1970 and the

Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-570), the world’s first

law to criminalize money laundering.

Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act (U.S. Public Law 107-56), “The International

Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001,”

contains most, although not all, of the AML-related provisions of this diverse

law. The purpose of Title III is “increasing the strength of US measures to

prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering and the

financing of terrorism, to provide a national mandate for subjecting to special

scrutiny foreign jurisdictions, financial organizations operating outside the

United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts

that pose particular opportunities for criminal abuse, and to ensure that all

appropriate elements of the financial services industry are subject to

appropriate requirements to report potential money laundering transactions
to proper authorities.”

As noted in its purpose, the USA PATRIOT Act has implications for US
organizations and non-US organizations that do business in the U.S. It is

important to note that the regulations issued under the USA PATRIOT Act by

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 220

Version 6.44

the US Department of the Treasury provide the detailed requirements that

financial organizations must follow to comply with the provisions of the Act.
These regulations are compiled in 31 Code of Federal Regulation Chapter X.

Key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act stem from the premise that
international access points to the US financial system must be controlled.

Thus, the law covers a wide range of AML/CFT provisions affecting foreign

businesses. These include the following:

Section 311: Special Measures for Primary Money Laundering

Concerns (31 U.S.C. 5318A)

This section provides the US Department of the Treasury with the authority to

apply graduated, proportionate measures against a foreign jurisdiction,

foreign financial organization, type of international transaction, and type of

account that the Treasury Secretary determines to be a “primary money

laundering concern.” By designating a country or financial organization as a

primary money laundering concern, the US government can force US banks

to halt many of their financial dealings with the designee. Once identified, the

Treasury Department can require US financial organizations to follow any or all
of the following five special measures:

1.  Keep records and/or file reports on certain financial transactions, including

a description of the transactions, the identities and addresses of the

participants in the transactions, and the identities of the beneficial owners

of the funds involved.

2.  Obtain information on the beneficial ownership of any account opened or
maintained in the United States by a foreign person or a foreign person’s

representative.

3.  Identify and obtain information about customers who are permitted to use,

or whose transactions are routed through, a foreign bank’s payable-

through account.

4.  Identify and obtain information about customers permitted to use, or

whose transactions are routed through, a foreign bank’s correspondent

account.

5.  Close certain payable-through and correspondent accounts.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 221

Version 6.44

To ensure that all relevant factors are considered, the Treasury Secretary

must consult with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General before
designating a jurisdiction, organization, or specific type of transaction or

account as a primary money laundering concern.

Section 311 actions are distinct from designations brought by Treasury’s Office

of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which are applied more broadly and can

also trigger asset freezing obligations.

Section 312: Correspondent and Private Banking Accounts (31

U.S.C. 5318(i))

This section requires due diligence and, in certain situations, EDD for foreign
correspondent accounts, which includes virtually all account relationships that

organizations can have with a foreign financial organization, as well as private

banking for non-US people.

The correspondent banking portions of the rule apply to US banks, credit

unions, thrift organizations, trust banks, broker-dealers, futures commission

merchants and introducing brokers in commodities and mutual funds, and

US-based agencies and branches of foreign banks.

Foreign financial organizations covered by the rule include foreign banks,

foreign branches of US banks, foreign businesses that would be considered

broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers in

commodities and mutual funds that operate in the United States, and money

transmitters and currency exchangers organized in a foreign country.

The due diligence program must be “appropriate, specific, and risk-based,”

and, when necessary, include enhanced policies, procedures, and controls

reasonably designed to identify and report suspected money laundering in a

correspondent account maintained in the United States. This due diligence

program must also be included in the organization’s AML program.

The due diligence program must address three measures:

1.  Determining whether enhanced due diligence is necessary

2.  Assessing the money laundering risk presented by the correspondent

account

3.  Applying risk-based procedures and controls reasonably designed to

detect and report suspected money laundering

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 222

Version 6.44

Pursuant to implementing the regulation, EDD procedures must be applied to

a correspondent account established for a foreign bank operating under:

•  An offshore banking license

•  A license issued by a foreign country designated as noncooperative by an
international organization, with which designation the Treasury Secretary

agrees

•  A license issued by a foreign country that has been designated by the

Treasury Secretary as warranting special measures pursuant to Section 311

of the USA PATRIOT Act

The EDD that must be implemented in these situations includes:

•  Conducting enhanced scrutiny for possible money laundering and

suspicious transactions, including:

o  Obtaining information relating to the foreign bank’s AML program
o  Monitoring transactions in and out of the correspondent account in a

manner reasonably designed to detect possible money laundering and

suspicious activity

o  Obtaining information about the correspondent account that is being

used as a payable-through account

•  Determining whether the correspondent account is being used by other

foreign banks that have a correspondent relationship with the foreign bank

for which the correspondent account was established, and taking

reasonable steps to assess and mitigate the money laundering risks

associated with such accounts

•  Determining, for any such foreign bank whose shares are not publicly
traded, the identity of each of the owners of the foreign bank with the

power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of securities of the bank and

the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner

The private banking portions of the rule apply to the same organizations

covered by the correspondent banking provisions. Such organizations must

maintain a due diligence program for private banking accounts and conduct

enhanced scrutiny of private banking accounts maintained for senior foreign
political figures, their immediate family members, and their close associates.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 223

Version 6.44

Under the rule, a private banking account is defined as (a) an account with a

minimum aggregate deposit of US$1 million, (b) an account for one or more
non-US people, and (c) an account that is assigned to a bank employee acting

as a liaison with the non-US person.

For covered private banking accounts, US organizations must take reasonable

steps to:

•  Ascertain the identity of all nominal and beneficial owners of the accounts

•  Ascertain whether any such owner is a senior foreign political figure

•  Ascertain the source of the funds in the account and the purpose and

expected use of the account

•  Monitor the account to ensure its activity is consistent with the information
provided regarding the source of funds and the purpose and expected use

of the account, as needed, to guard against money laundering, and to

report any suspected money laundering or suspicious activity

In ascertaining whether an account owner is a senior foreign political figure,

the organization must take reasonable steps to determine if the person is a

“current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative,

military, or judicial branches of a foreign government.” The definition also

covers officials of foreign political parties and government-owned

commercial enterprises, as well as immediate family members and persons
who are “widely and publicly known” to be close associates.

An organization that maintains accounts for these individuals must conduct

enhanced scrutiny that is reasonably designed to detect if the funds “may

involve the proceeds of foreign corruption,” which includes any asset or

property obtained “through misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement of

public funds, the unlawful conversion of property of a foreign government, or
… bribery or extortion.”

Version 6.44

Section 313: Prohibition on Correspondent Accounts for

Foreign Shell Banks (31 U.S.C. 5318(j))

This section prohibits US banks and securities brokers and dealers from
maintaining correspondent accounts for foreign, unregulated shell banks that

have no physical presence. The term physical presence is defined as a place

of business that is maintained by a foreign bank located at a fixed address
(versus solely an electronic address) where it:

•

Is authorized to conduct banking activities

•  Employs one or more individuals on a full-time basis at that location

•  Maintains operating records at that location

•

Is subject to inspection by the banking authority which licensed it at that

location

The term shell bank does not include a bank that is a regulated affiliate of a

bank that maintains a physical presence.

The section also requires financial organizations to take reasonable steps to

ensure that foreign banks with correspondent accounts do not themselves

permit access to such accounts by foreign shell banks. Banks and securities

brokers are permitted to use a certification form to comply with the rule. That

process requires the foreign banks to certify at least once every three years

that they are not themselves shell banks and that they do not permit shell

banks access to the US correspondent account through a nested

correspondent relationship.

Sections 314(a) and 314(b): Help “law enforcement identify, disrupt, and prevent

terrorist acts and money laundering activities by encouraging further

cooperation among law enforcement, regulators, and financial institutions to

share information regarding those suspected of being involved in terrorism or
money laundering.”

•  Section 314(a): FinCEN’s regulations under Section 314(a) enable US
federal, state, local, and foreign (European Union) law enforcement

agencies, through FinCEN, to reach out to more than 43,000 points of

contact at more than 22,000 financial organizations to locate accounts and

transactions of persons who may be involved in terrorism or money

laundering. To obtain documents from a financial organization that has

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 225

Version 6.44

reported a match of a subject, a law enforcement agency must meet the

legal standards that apply to the specific investigative tool that it chooses
to use to obtain the documents.

•  Section 314(b): 314(b) information sharing is a voluntary program. Entities
that may participate in 314(b) include US financial organizations subject to

an AML program requirement under FinCEN regulations, any association of

such financial organizations, and unincorporated associations of financial
organizations. This includes the following types of US financial

organizations:

o  Banks, credit unions, and other depository institutions
o  Casinos and card clubs
o  Money services businesses
o  Brokers and dealers in securities
o  Mutual funds

Insurance companies

o
o  Futures commission merchants and introducing brokers in

commodities

o  Dealers in precious metals, precious stones, and jewels
o  Operators of credit card systems
o  Loan and finance companies
o  Government-sponsored enterprises

Section 314(b) allows these financial organizations to share information with

one another regarding individuals, entities, organizations, and countries for

purposes of identifying and, when appropriate, reporting activities that might

involve possible terrorist activity or money laundering. Section 314(b) also

allows for safe harbor liability protections to share information related to

activities the financial organization suspects might involve money laundering

or terrorist activity, even if the financial organization or association cannot

identify specific proceeds of a specified unlawful activity being laundered or

the activity does not constitute a “transaction.” Expanded details around
Section 314(b) were included in a FinCEN Section 314(b) Fact Sheet issued in

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 226

Version 6.44

December 2020, which rescinded previous guidance and an administrative

ruling.

•  Section 319(a): Forfeiture from US correspondent account (18 U.S.C. 981(k)).
In situations in which funds have been deposited with a foreign bank, this
section permits the US government to seize funds in the same amount

from a correspondent bank account in the United States that has been

opened and maintained for the foreign bank. The US government is not
required to trace the funds, because they are deemed to have been

deposited into the correspondent account. However, the owner of the

funds may contest the seizure order.

•  Section 319(b): Records relating to correspondent accounts for foreign
banks (31 U.S.C. 5318(k)). This section allows the appropriate federal
banking agency to require a financial organization to produce within 120

hours (5 days) records or information related to the organization’s AML

compliance or related to a customer of the organization or any account

opened, maintained, administered, or managed in the United States by the

financial organization.

The section also allows the Treasury Secretary and the Attorney General to

subpoena records of a foreign bank that maintains a correspondent

account in the United States. The subpoena can request any records

relating to the account, including records located outside the United

States. If the foreign bank fails to comply with or fails to contest the

subpoena, the Treasury Secretary or the Attorney General can order the

US financial organization to close the correspondent account within 10

days of receipt of such an order.

Additionally, the section requires foreign banks to designate a registered

agent in the United States to accept service of subpoenas pursuant to this

section. Furthermore, US banks and securities brokers and dealers who

maintain correspondent accounts for foreign banks must keep records of

the identity of the 25 percent owners of the foreign bank, unless it is

publicly traded, as well as the name of the correspondent bank’s

registered agent in the US.

This information is generally collected on the certification form used to

comply with Section 313 and must be updated at least every three years or

more frequently, if the information is no longer correct.

Version 6.44

Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) of 2020

The AMLA represents a notable development in the US AML regulatory

structure first and foremost because it was the first AML-related law of
substance (excluding the USA PATRIOT Act recertification) to be passed since

the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001.

The law’s infrastructure requires several key AML initiatives and more broadly
shifts some regulatory priorities. One of the key distinctions between the USA

PATRIOT Act and the AMLA is that the latter was passed as part of the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which codifies the US budget and

expenditures for the Department of Defense. This is notable because it is not

directly promulgated by a US regulatory agency (e.g., OCC, FinCEN), and it
creates a context for the language of the AMLA itself.

In addition to enhancing US AML laws (e.g., the BSA), the AMLA shifts the focus

of AML compliance from a regulatory perspective to national defense. The

key priorities of the AMLA are to streamline AML/CFT systems, solidify by law a

risk-based approach requirement to AML/CFT compliance programs. This

includes “…the establishment by financial institutions of reasonably designed

risk-based programs to combat money laundering and the financing of

terrorism”; creates a reporting database with uniform beneficial ownership

requirements; and increases FinCEN’s investigatory powers (e.g., ability to

subpoena foreign bank records when those banks maintain US accounts); and

requires enhanced cooperation and information sharing among financial

institutions, regulators, and ultimately law enforcement-oriented

agencies. The most critical language in these provisions is that, when new

regulations under the AMLA are finalized, requirements should strike the

proper balance between regulatory compliance and generating reporting

from financial institutions (i.e., SARs and CTRs) to ensure a “high degree of
usefulness to law enforcement.’’

One important omission is that the AMLA does not contain the words

cannabis, marijuana, or hemp. Therefore, cannabis-related banking remains

unclear. In contrast, Canada has implemented laws related to this emerging

risk.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 228

Version 6.44

Additional expansions under the AMLA for financial organizations include:

•  An expansion of civil monetary penalties to so-called “repeat” BSA violators

•  New criminal offenses, such as concealing the source of funds of a

monetary instrument owned or held by a senior foreign political figure

•  Clawback provisions for remuneration and bonuses when the person who
violated the BSA was a “partner, director, officer, or employee of a financial

institution” at the time the violation of law occurred

•  Prohibitions of individuals convicted of BSA violations from sitting on the

board of a financial institution

•  FinCEN’s authority to not only subpoena foreign financial institutions’ US

account activity, but also foreign accounts

•  FinCEN’s authority to demand closure of correspondent accounts and

impose daily fines for the failure to do so

New requirements for the regulatory community include:

•  Require FinCEN to provide reports on how SARs and CTRs are used and

which key areas make them more “useful” to law enforcement

•  Encourage enhanced international cooperation between countries and

their FIUs

•  Provide a report on how to streamline and reduce the burden
for financial organizations to report “noncomplex” cases and

matters such as structuring

•  Create a report with guidelines on how to derisk accounts and relationship
in a safe, meaningful way that does not inhibit legitimate access to the

global financial system

•  Report on more or less “approved” ways to enhance AML reporting

through the utilization of more advanced technology

•  Publish information relating to emerging risks and trends in money

laundering that can be utilized to develop and/or enhance screening

typologies

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Act

Along with the AMLA, the NDAA also brings a legal requirement to expand the

Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Act (KARRA). KARRA is effectively a

whistleblower program for individuals who report on the proceeds of
corruption moving through US financial organizations. This is notable because

it aligns with international guidance and efforts by groups such as the FATF
and the Wolfsberg Group to identify criminals in politics, as well as professional

money launderers, who are referred to colloquially as “enablers.” Another key

provision of the AMLA is the expansion of whistleblower protection for
individuals who provide “original” information related to violations of AML laws

to regulators and/or prosecutors, which follows international guidance

regarding whistleblower programs.

Beneficial ownership

Acknowledging the number of media events (e.g., Panama Papers, Pandora

Papers) in which limited liability corporations and other corporate structures

were used nearly anonymously to move vast sums of money, the AMLA aims

to create a central repository for all beneficial ownership

information. The structure of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) registry

is not yet clear, but the intention is to pierce the corporate veil of anonymity

for two key reasons: 1) to create transparency within those structures to find

and remove potential criminals hiding behind them; and 2) to create a

database for use by state and federal law enforcement entities, aimed at

mitigating national security risks. The CTA utilizes a number of exemptions;

however, the CTA itself and the exemptions were drafted in response to FATF

criticism that the US had not policed entities created in or owned by US
parties.

The CTA will ask business owners to provide, among other requirements:

•  A legal form of personal identification

•  Applications to form a corporate entity

•

Information on the registering agent

Strategic priorities

International money laundering has long been a concern and consideration

for AML/CFT risk. This section of the AMLA matches international guidance

concerning:

•  The screening of customers and business

•  Transaction value and volume to and from high-risk jurisdictions

•  Potentially high-risk third-party transactions from these jurisdictions

The AMLA also calls for the establishment of the first AML/CFT strategic

priorities, which should be announced within six months of the law’s

passage. The strategic priorities align to FATF, the Wolfsberg Group, and other

authorities’ guidance on how money is laundered, for what purpose, and who

is moving the funds. From a national security perspective, the strategic

priorities heavily reference cryptocurrency/VC and other modalities of money

laundering.

At a high level, the eight strategic priorities are:

1.  Corruption: Noting that “corrupt actors and their financial facilitators may
seek to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the US financial system to

launder their assets and obscure the proceeds of crime,” this objective

echoes the Wolfsberg Group recommendations and guidance on the

methods and means used by corrupt political figures and their enablers to

launder the proceeds of corruption.

2.  Cybercrime and relevant cybersecurity and virtual currency considerations:
This strategic priority centers on cybercrime (i.e., “any illegal activity that

involves a computer, another digital device, or a computer network”), but it

draws parallels to traditional cybercrime (e.g., wire fraud and account

takeover) and emerging cybercrime (e.g., ransomware, in which the crime

takes place on a computer/system, but that system’s data/information is

not the actual target of the crime). This priority focuses on the misuse of

cryptocurrency as a means to extort and move the proceeds of all forms

of cybercrime.

3.  Foreign and domestic terrorist financing: Consistent with FATF guidance
and advisories issued by FINTRAC in Canada, this priority focuses on

the misuse of the financial system for both global and domestic terrorism.
It is significant that domestic terrorism is included from an

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 231

Version 6.44

AML/CFT perspective, and this strategic priority correlates the similarities

between domestic and international terrorist activity. It also references
the distinctions and similarities between terrorist activity (i.e., the attack

itself) and terrorist support (e.g., expenses for travel, housing, food, etc.,
prior to the activity itself).

4.  Fraud: Acknowledging that crimes such as fraud “generate the bulk of illicit
proceeds in the United States,” this priority lists “bank, consumer, health
care, securities and investment, and tax fraud” as the major sources of

illicit activity within the US. There are parallels to the CTA, in that fraudulent

incorporated entities are frequently utilized to launder the proceeds of
fraud, although not as frequently as crimes such as tax fraud and tax

evasion. This priority also draws a correlation to the “cybercrime” priority,
outlining the utilization of bank and wire fraud to access accounts that are

then be used to move the proceeds of cybercrime (e.g., business email

compromise schemes).

5.  Transnational criminal organization activity: Again, as a

national security priority rather than simply regulatory compliance, this

strategic priority uses the term “crime-terror nexus” to denote the

enablement of money laundering for terrorist financing and the use of

underlying crimes to raise money for terrorism. Drawing on references

from the other strategic priorities, this priority specifically notes that

organized crime groups might engage in or launder the proceeds of

criminal activities and “maligned” activities, including “foreign election

interference, attempts to stoke social unrest, and other profit-driven

criminal acts” to gain the favor of individuals in seats of political power

across the globe.

6.  Drug trafficking organization activity: This strategic priority builds on

international guidance concerning the use of the global financial system to

place, layer, and integrate the proceeds of drug trafficking activities. It

further notes that the US financial system might be used as a financial

“transit” point for those proceeds, as well as their final holding place after

laundering overseas.  This priority also references both domestic and

internationally linked sales of fentanyl and related components.

7.  Human trafficking and human smuggling: This priority reflects the ongoing
crime-terror nexus and notes that the victims of human trafficking might

be used to launder money originating from the very crime by which they

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 232

Version 6.44

are being victimized. Like terrorist financing, this priority notes that often

more “benign” appearing expenses, such as lodging, travel, and food, can
be indicators of potential human trafficking.

8.  Proliferation financing: Also from the national security perspective, this
priority outlines both geographic and transactional risk (e.g., dual-use

goods). It notes that often “gatekeepers, front or shell companies,

exchange houses, or the illicit exploitation of international trade” are
central to the laundering and movement of funds related to proliferation.

The Reach of the US Criminal Money
Laundering and Civil Forfeiture Laws

The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, the first criminal money

laundering law of the United States, is a powerful legal weapon that may be

used if the property involved in the financial transaction at issue represents

the proceeds of at least one designated underlying crime—a “specified

unlawful activity” (SUA). SUAs include virtually every US crime that produces

economic advantage, including aircraft piracy, wire fraud, bank fraud,

copyright infringement, embezzlement, export violations, illegal gambling,

narcotics offenses, racketeering, and even some environmental crimes (18
USC 1956 and 1957).

This money laundering law also applies to foreign individuals and foreign

financial organizations if the financial transaction occurs in whole or in part in

the United States or if the foreign financial organization maintains a bank

account at a US financial organization.

Although the prosecution must prove the existence of the proceeds of an

SUA, it does not need to prove that the accused knew the exact source of the

funds. The prosecution must prove only that the defendant knew that the

funds came “from some form … of activity that constitutes a felony under

state, federal, or foreign law, regardless of whether or not such activity” is an

SUA (18 USC 1956(c)(1)). Courts have often ruled that willful blindness, which

has been defined as “the deliberate avoidance of knowledge of the facts,” is

the equivalent of actual knowledge. Willful blindness can be proven by the
circumstances surrounding the transaction and the defendant’s conduct.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 233

Version 6.44

Section 319(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act, discussed above, greatly

strengthened the forfeiture powers over the funds of foreign persons and
organizations. If the funds the United States pursues are deposited in a foreign

bank that keeps an interbank account at a US bank, the United States may
bring a case to forfeit the crime-tainted funds in the US account.

US criminal money laundering and civil
forfeiture laws (Case example)

On August 5, 2021, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that more

than US$1.2 billion in funds misappropriated from the 1Malaysia Development

Berhad (1MBD) investment fund had been returned to the people of Malaysia.

From 2009 to 2015, over US$4.5 billion in funds from 1MBD was embezzled and

laundered to purchase luxury real estate, fine art, hotels, fund a movie

production, and pay bribes. The US District Courts in California and the District
of Columbia led efforts to seize over US$1.7 billion in stolen assets.

The case exemplified the fact that all transactions that involve the US financial

system are subject to US laws. Therefore, the US government can file a

forfeiture complaint based on an allegation that money or property was

involved in or represents the proceeds of crime.

The 1MDB investment fund was created by the government of Malaysia to

promote economic development in the country through global partnerships

and foreign direct investment. However, high-level 1MDB officials and their

associates embezzled and laundered funds through the US, Switzerland,

Singapore, and Luxemburg.

To file a civil forfeiture complaint, the US government must be able to identify

the property to be seized. The US government worked with international

partners to assist with tracing the use of the proceeds of the criminally

derived funds. It determined that funds were used in the US to purchase

luxury homes in Beverly Hills and New York and to invest in a boutique hotel in

Beverly Hills and the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan. Funds were also used to

purchase luxury real estate in London, a 300-foot superyacht, and fine art by

the artists Monet and Van Gogh.

Using fraudulent documents and representations, the co-conspirators

laundered the funds through a series of complex transactions and shell
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 234

Version 6.44

companies with bank accounts located in the US and abroad. These

transactions concealed the origin, source, and ownership of the funds, and
ultimately passed through US financial institutions to then be used to acquire

and invest in assets located in the US and overseas.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service’s

(IRS’s) Criminal Investigation agency led the investigation into the

misappropriated funds. Beginning in 2016, US courts and the DOJ’s Money
Laundering and Asset Forfeiture Section filed 41 civil forfeiture actions and

seized over US$1.7 billion in stolen assets. The US DOJ received significant

assistance from international government agencies and law enforcement
from Malaysia, Singapore, and Luxembourg. These actions represent the

largest civil forfeiture action ever initiated by the US DOJ to date.

Key takeaways

•  All transactions that touch the US financial system are subject to US laws.

•  The US government can file a forfeiture complaint based on an allegation
that the money or property was involved in or represents the proceeds of

crime.

•  The US government must be able to identify the property to be seized to

file a civil forfeiture complaint.

•  The US government works with international partners to assist with tracing

the use of proceeds of criminally derived funds; this cooperation is

essential for fighting financial crime.

Office of Foreign Assets Control

In addition to these laws and regulations, financial organizations and

businesses in other countries must recognize the extraterritorial reach of

regulations enforced by the US Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign

Assets Control (OFAC).

OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US

foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries,

terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and criminals engaged in activities

related to the proliferation of WMD. OFAC acts under presidential wartime and

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 235

Version 6.44

national emergency powers, as well as authority granted by specific

legislation, to impose controls on transactions and freeze foreign assets under
US jurisdiction. Many of its sanctions are based on United Nations and other

international mandates that are multilateral in scope and involve close
cooperation with allied governments.

OFAC sanction programs prohibit transactions and require the blocking of

assets of persons and organizations that appear on one of several lists that
OFAC issues periodically. The OFAC sanctions lists primarily include:

•  Country-based sanctions: Sanctions brought against entire countries that
prohibit nearly all types of transactions (e.g., North Korea, Iran, Cuba)

•  List-based sanctions: Examples include the Specially Designated Nationals
and Blocked Persons (SDN) list, Consolidated Sanctions list, and Foreign

Sanctions Evader list, among others

•  Secondary sanctions: sanctions directed at non-US, non-sanctioned,

parties for transactions and other specific dealings with parties subject to

OFAC sanctions (e.g., Iranian and Russian businesses and sectors)

•  Sectoral sanctions: Known as “surgical or smart” sanctions in that they are
applied against very focused targets to reduce subsequent collateral

economic damage; for example, instead of sanctioning an entire country,

sectoral sanctions target a specific sector such as energy, finance, or

defense

All US people must comply with OFAC regulations, including all US citizens and

permanent resident aliens, regardless of where they are located; all people

and entities within the United States; and all US-incorporated entities and their

foreign branches. In the case of specific programs, such as those regarding

North Korea, Syria, and Cuba, all foreign subsidiaries owned and controlled by

companies also must comply. Certain programs also require foreign persons

in possession of US-origin goods to comply.

OFAC recognizes that complying with sanctions can be difficult and might

take time for some US parties that are newly sanctioned or currently engaging

in countries, and the sanctions might adversely impact humanitarian

assistance and related trade. As such, OFAC requires a license authorization to

engage in a transaction that otherwise would be prohibited. There are two

types of licenses: general licenses and specific licenses. A general license
authorizes a particular type of transaction for a class of persons without the

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 236

Version 6.44

need to apply for a license. A specific license is a written document issued by

OFAC to a specific person or entity, authorizing a specific transaction in
response to a written license application.

OFAC also has the power to impose significant penalties on individuals and
entities that are found to be in violation of the blocking orders within each of

the sanction programs.

Office of Foreign Assets Control (Case
example: US sanctions)

In 2014, OFAC reached a record US$963 million settlement with BNP Paribas

SA (BNPP), Paris, France, following a US$8.9 billion penalty imposed for

apparent violations of US sanctions regulations. The settlement resolved

OFAC’s investigation into BNPP’s systemic practice of concealing, removing,

omitting, and obscuring references to information about US-sanctioned

parties in almost 4,000 financial transactions routed to or through US banks

between 2005 and 2012. This was in apparent violation of US sanctions

involving Sudan, Iran, Cuba and Burma. BNPP’s methods for processing

sanctions-related payments to or through the US included removing

references to sanctioned parties, replacing sanctioned parties with BNPP’s

name or a code word, or otherwise structuring the payments in a manner that

did not identify the involvement of the sanctioned parties in the transactions.

Key takeaways

•  Regulated firms should have robust controls, including independent quality
control and assurance, in place to detect “stripping” (i.e., the deliberate

removal of key payment-related information), a common sanctions

evasion technique.

•  Non-US banks can be fined for noncompliance with OFAC sanctions if their
transactions have a US connection, such as passing through a US bank.

•  Fines and penalties associated with sanctions noncompliance can be

significant and damaging to a regulated business.

Programs

Assessing AML/CFT Risk

An AML/CFT program is an essential component of a financial organization’s

compliance regime. The primary goal of an AML/CFT program is to protect

the organization against money laundering, terrorist financing, and other

financial crimes, and to ensure that the organization is in full compliance with

relevant laws and regulations. For that reason, designing, structuring, and

implementing these programs should be high priorities for any financial

organization.

An AML/CFT program should be risk-based. Certain aspects of a financial

organization’s business pose greater money laundering risks than others and

therefore require additional controls to mitigate those risks. Other aspects of

business present a minimal risk and do not need the same level of attention.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 238

Version 6.44

Depending on the size of the organization, the AML function might be

managed as a dedicated/standalone department, integrated into other
corporate departments such as the legal department, or performed by

people who have other compliance duties. Regardless of the size of the
organization, the program should have an enterprise-wide view of AML/CFT

efforts.

The AML/CFT program should establish minimum standards for the enterprise
that are reasonably designed to comply with all applicable laws and

regulations. It can be supplemented with the policies and procedures of

various lines of business or legal entities that address specific areas, such as
private banking, trade finance, cash handling, institutional banking, wealth

management, and investigations. Compliance programs should also include

corporate governance and overall management of money laundering and

terrorist financing risks.

Before designing an AML/CFT program, it is imperative to understand what is

required of a financial organization, its employees, and customers by the laws

and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which the organization does

business and where its customers are located. The financial organization’s

internal policies and risk-management standards related to the business must

also be taken into consideration. Anyone needing advice on the complexities

of AML/CFT legislation before developing an AML/CFT program should

consult a competent advisor, even if it means seeking external assistance.

This section explains what to consider when designing a compliance program;

how to assess risk; how to identify, manage, document, and follow up on

suspicious activities; how to know your customer and employee; how to audit

your program effectively; and what you need to know about training and

screening employees.

Introduction

Understanding what is legally required of an organization and its employees

and customers is essential to a successful program. It is also important to
understand the expectations of the relevant AML/CFT regulators and/or

supervisory authorities.

FATF and its numerous member countries, such as the UK and US, urge risk-
based controls. Per FATF, there are circumstances when the risk of money

laundering or terrorist financing is higher, and EDD measures have to be taken.

A risk-based approach requires financial organizations to implement systems

and controls that are commensurate with the specific risks of money

laundering and terrorist financing they face. Therefore, assessing this risk is

one of the most important steps in creating an effective AML/CFT compliance

program. As money laundering risks increase, stronger controls are

necessary. However, all categories of risk—whether low-, medium-, or high-

level—must be identified and mitigated by the application of controls, such as

verification of customer identity, customer due diligence (CDD) policies,
suspicious activity monitoring, and economic sanctions screening.

The majority of governments around the world accept that the risk-based

approach is preferable to a more prescriptive approach in the area of
AML/CFT because it is more:

•  Flexible: Money laundering and terrorist financing risks vary over time and

across jurisdictions, customers, products, and delivery channels.

•  Effective: Companies are better equipped than legislators to effectively

assess and mitigate the specific money laundering and terrorist financing

risks they face.

•  Proportionate: A risk-based approach promotes a more practical and

intelligent approach to fighting money laundering and terrorist financing

than a checklist-type approach. It also allows organizations to minimize the

adverse impact of AML procedures on their low-risk customers.

No financial organization can reasonably be expected to detect all

wrongdoing by customers, including money laundering. But when an

organization develops systems and procedures to detect, monitor, and report
high-risk customers and transactions, it decreases the likelihood of being

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 240

Version 6.44

harmed by criminals and subjected to government sanctions and penalties.

The risks a financial organization faces depend on many factors, including the
geographical regions (i.e., jurisdictions) involved, customer types, and the

products and services offered.

When assessing risk, FATF recommends considering:

•  Customer risk factors, such as nonresident customers, cash-intensive

businesses, complex ownership structures, and companies with bearer
shares

•  Country or geographic/jurisdictional risks, such as countries with

inadequate AML/CFT systems, countries subject to sanctions or embargos,
countries involved with funding or supporting terrorist activities, and

countries with significant levels of corruption

•  Product, service, transaction, and delivery channel risk factors, such as

private banking, anonymous transactions, and payments received from

unknown third parties

Although it is not necessarily mandated by AML/CFT legislation in various

jurisdictions, many organizations find it valuable to develop money

laundering/terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk models that assess risk at the

enterprise level, with the customer element providing for ML/TF risk

assessments at the customer-type level (e.g., individual, company, or trust)

and the specific customer level (i.e., an ML/TF risk assessment of the

customer’s entire relationship with the organization). Moreover, some

jurisdictions also seek a separate sanctions assessment for reporting entities.

Maintaining an AML/CFT Risk Model

A risk-based approach identifies, manages, and analyzes AML/CFT risk in

order to design and effectively implement appropriate controls. As such, it is

critical that risk ratings accurately reflect the risks present, provide meaningful

assessments that lead to practical steps to mitigate the risks, are periodically

reviewed, and, when necessary, are regularly updated.

A risk-based analysis should include appropriate inherent and residual risks at
the country, sectoral, legal entity, and business relationship level, among

others. As a result of this analysis, the financial organization should develop a

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 241

Version 6.44

thorough understanding of the inherent risks in its customer base, products,

delivery channels, services offered (including proposed new services), and
the jurisdictions within which it and its customers do business. This

understanding should be based on operational, transaction and other internal
information collected by the organization, as well as external sources.

In identifying all ML/TF risks, all relevant information must be taken into

account. This usually requires expert input from the business lines, risk
management, compliance, and legal units, together with advice from external

experts, when necessary. In particular, new business products and services

should be evaluated for money laundering and sanctions vulnerabilities, and
appropriate controls should be implemented before launching them into the

market. There is also a growing body of publicly available, helpful guidance on
ML/TF risk assessments that should be taken into consideration. Such

guidance is regularly published by FATF, FSRBs, regulatory agencies, other

institutions such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the IMF, the
World Bank, and jurisdiction-specific information, guidance, and advisories.

Risk is dynamic and needs to be continuously managed. It should also be

noted that the environment in which each organization operates is subject to

continual change. Externally, the political changes of a jurisdiction and

whether economic sanctions are imposed or removed can affect a country’s

risk rating. Internally, organizations respond to market and customer demands

by merging or acquiring other companies, introducing new products and

services, and implementing new delivery systems. The combination of these

changes makes it critical that the ML/TF risk model is subject to regular

review. In some countries, there is a legislative obligation for such reviews to

be undertaken on a regular basis—usually annually or when new products,
delivery channels, and customer types are introduced.

Version 6.44

Understanding AML/CFT Risk

AML/CFT risk categories can be categorized by the following levels:

•  Prohibited: The organization will not tolerate any dealings of any kind, given
the risk. This category could include transactions with countries subject to

economic sanctions or designated as state sponsors of terrorism, such as

those on the UN and OFAC lists.

•  High risk: The risks are significant, but they are not necessarily prohibited.
To mitigate the heightened risk presented, the financial organization
should apply more stringent controls to reduce the ML/FT risk, such as

conducting EDD and more rigorous transaction monitoring. Countries that

maintain a reputation for corruption or drug trafficking are generally

considered high risk. High-risk customers could include PEPs and specific

types of money services businesses or cash-intensive businesses. High-risk

products and services could include correspondent banking, private

banking, cash services (e.g., bulk currency shipments), and international

wire transfers.

•  Medium Risk: Medium risks merit additional scrutiny, but they do not rise to

the level of high risk, such as a retail business that accepts low to moderate

levels of cash but is not considered cash-intensive.

•  Low Risk: This represents the baseline risk of money laundering. Typically,

low risk indicates normal, expected activity.

Version 6.44

AML/CFT Risk Scoring

A risk-scoring model uses numeric values to determine the category of risk

(geography, customer type, and products and services) and the overall
customer risk. For example, each category could be given a score between 1

and 10, with 10 being the highest risk. The individual categories could be

scored, with 1–3 being standard risk, 4–8 being medium risk, and 9–10 being
high risk. Such a model is particularly helpful when analyzing product risk,

because it helps determine appropriate controls for the products.

The three categories are then combined to give a composite score. A simple

model would just add the totals from the categories, which would yield a

score between 3 and 30. The model can be made more complex by

weighting each of the factors differently, such as putting more emphasis on

the type of customer, as opposed to the product or country. The model can

be made even more elaborate by, for example, creating combinations of

factors that will determine the overall rating. The degree of complexity is up to

the organization; the more complex, the more likely the rating will reflect the
customer’s overall risk.

In a simple three-element model like the first one described above, care must

be taken to avoid inadvertently discounting any element that is an outlier from

the other elements. For example, if each element has a risk score of 3, the

composite or aggregate score will be 9. However, if two of the three elements

have a score of 1 and the other has a score of 7, the composite risk score is

also 9. In this case, there is a need to identify how and in what manner the

element scoring 7 should be mitigated. This could mean implementing a more
rigorous control or introducing restrictions.

It is important to understand that, when the categories are combined, the

customer’s risk profile becomes clearer. For example, when you combine a

product with a customer type, the combination can radically change the level

of risk. For example, you have a small, foreign, private company about which

you do not have much information that wants to open a checking account

with online wire transfer capabilities. That customer’s ability to rapidly transfer

funds raises its risk level. The customer may also have higher risk ratings for

geography, customer type, and products and services. Another example is a

publicly listed domestic company listed on a major stock market that wants to

establish an employee retirement plan. Public companies must provide

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 245

Version 6.44

extensive information to be listed on a major stock market. What is more,

retirement plan accounts are not very vulnerable to money laundering. As a
result, this customer and account will pose a much lower risk than the

example of the foreign private company.

The next step is to determine what thresholds to establish for each risk

category. The organization should ensure that high-risk relationships do not

represent too large a segment of the portfolio; this is not to say the scores
should be adapted to fit the customer portfolio, rather, because high-risk

customers do require more attention. In addition, if the portfolio is overly

weighted toward high risk, the overall risk level in the organization could be
too great to support.

Assessing AML/CFT risk is an ongoing and evolving component of maintaining

a compliant AML/CFT program. It is critical to evaluate the risk-scoring model

and update the risk assessment to include changes in products, services,

distribution channels, customers, and jurisdiction to ensure an accurate

reflection of AML/CFT risk. Although there is generally no requirement to

update a risk assessment on a continuous or specified periodic basis, risk

assessments should be updated before the launch of a new product, an

acquisition of another financial organization, and whenever there are

significant risk environment changes.

Periodically reassessing risk-rating criteria will reveal if the customers that are

scored as higher risk are actually more likely to engage in potentially

suspicious activity. If they are not, it may be appropriate to reassess the risk-
scoring model.

Assessing the Dynamic Risk of Customers

Another critical component of a risk assessment is a process for reevaluating

risks and determining when a customer risk rating should be raised or

lowered. Identifying the key factors that should trigger such a reevaluation is

essential to efficient allocation of limited resources.

In addition to the initial assessment of the inherent risk of a customer, it is

important to consider how a customer’s relationship—and risk—with the

organization changes over time. Perhaps the most important consideration
driving a customer’s risk rating is the actual activity that the customer

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 246

Version 6.44

conducts. For example, a student checking account may start out as low-risk.

But if records show that it is involved in a high number and volume of wires to
high-risk jurisdictions, indicating abnormal behavior for this customer type, the

risk level for the account may need to be raised. Similarly, a potentially higher
risk customer, such as an MSB or correspondent bank, might be engaging in

exactly the type of activity it indicated it would conduct. This customer may

not be as risky as one might think based solely on the inherent risk. As such,
the low- or standard-risk student customer based solely on inherent risk

might actually present more risk to the organization than the MSB, which

presents a high inherent risk.

As every financial organization develops transaction history with customers, it

should consider modifying the risk rating of the customer, based on:

•  Unusual activity, such as alerts, cases, and SAR filings

•  Receipt of law enforcement inquiries, such as subpoenas

•  Transactions that violate economic sanctions programs

•  Other considerations, such as significant volumes of activity where it would
not be expected, such as a domestic charity receiving multiple deposits

(e.g., cash and electronic transfers) and then engaging in large

international transactions, or businesses engaged in large volumes of cash

when this would not typically be expected

A financial organization’s knowledge of a customer based on its activity will

better determine the actual risk presented by a customer. As noted

elsewhere, higher risk customers, including those whose activity drives a

higher risk rating, should be subject to EDD to mitigate the risk. This EDD might

ultimately determine that the activity is not suspicious. If so, the customer

record should be updated to reflect a change that explains its activity.

AML/CFT Risk Identification

The core of a risk-based approach includes the assessment of risk of a

financial organization’s customers, geographical locations/jurisdictions, and
products and services. Following is a more in-depth explanation of these

three important risk factors.

Risk types/factors

Geographical

Customer

Products /
Services

Customer type

A vital step in a risk assessment is the analysis of the users of the products and

services that the organization offers. Customer types can include individuals,

listed companies, private companies, joint ventures, partnerships, and financial

institutions—basically anyone who wants to establish a relationship with the

organization.

Customers who have a history of involvement in criminal activities receive the

highest ratings. Political figures and individuals involved in political

organizations also score toward the top of the scale.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 248

Version 6.44

Multinational public corporations tend to score lower than private companies,

because there is much more publicly available information and due diligence
conducted on a corporation listed on a major stock exchange. Risks are

generally higher if a money launderer can hide behind corporate vehicles,
such as trusts, charities, limited liability companies, and structures, for which it

is difficult to identify the beneficial owners. The risk is even higher if

corporations are based in countries with inadequate AML requirements or
strict corporate secrecy protections.

Supervisory authorities in various countries have identified some types of

customers are inherently high risk for money laundering, including:

•  Banks

•  Casinos

•  Offshore corporations and banks located in tax/banking havens

•  Embassies

•  MSBs, including currency exchange houses, money remitters, and check

cashers

•  Virtual currency exchanges

•  Car, boat, and airplane dealerships

•  Used car and truck dealers and machine parts manufacturers

•  Professional service providers (e.g., attorneys, accountants, investment

brokers, and other third parties who act as financial liaisons for their clients)

•  Travel agencies

•  Broker-dealers in securities

•  Jewel, gem, and precious metals dealers

•

Import and export companies

•  Cash-intensive businesses (e.g., restaurants, retail stores, parking)

The list above does not include all industries that could be considered high

risk. It is important to note that industry alone does not determine risk. Many

other types of businesses could be used to launder money, and many other

factors need to be considered.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 249

Version 6.44

Implementing a strong screening process when onboarding a customer and

throughout the duration of the relationship are key components to identifying
high-risk customer types.

Geographic location/jurisdiction

A crucial step in devising a risk-scoring model involves evaluating jurisdictional

risk. In what countries or jurisdictions do your individual customers reside, and
what are their countries of citizenship? Where are your corporate customers

headquartered, and where do they conduct the majority of their business?

There is no definitive independent system for assessing the money laundering
risks of various territories and countries. Some organizations devise their own

methods, while others use a vendor solution. Whichever method is chosen, it

is essential that the risk-rating methodology be documented. In larger

organizations, the overall risk-management strategy might require the

outputs of the ML/TF risk model to be formally reviewed and endorsed by
executive and senior management.

When specifically evaluating money laundering risk, the terrorism and

sanctions lists published by governments and international organizations can

be a useful starting point. These include lists published by the United

Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), OFAC, FinCEN, the EU, the

World Bank, the United Nations Security Council, and each local jurisdictions’

regulatory and law enforcement agencies, such as Indonesia’s National

Counter Terrorism Agency. A risk management model should also take into

account whether a country is a member of FATF or an FSRB and has AML/CFT

requirements equivalent to international best practices.

Organizations might also consider the overall reputation of the countries in

question. In some, cash may be a standard medium of exchange. Other

countries might have politically unstable regimes and high levels of public or

private sector corruption. Some might have a reputation as bank secrecy

havens. Still others might be widely known to have high levels of internal drug

production or to be located in drug transit regions.

How can an organization identify high-risk countries?

•  The US Department of State issues an annual International Narcotics

Control Strategy Report, which rates more than 100 countries on their

money laundering controls.

•  Transparency International publishes a yearly Corruption Perceptions
Index, which rates more than 100 countries on perceived corruption.

•  FATF identifies jurisdictions with weak AML/CFT regimes and issues

country-specific mutual evaluation reports.

•

In the US, certain domestic jurisdictions are evaluated based on whether

they fall within government-identified higher risk geographic locations,
such as high-intensity drug trafficking areas (HIDTAs) and high-intensity

financial crime areas (HIFCAs).

Monitoring major news media is also recommended, and care should be taken

that all of the country lists are monitored on a regular basis for changes.

Products and services

An important element of assessing AML/CFT risk is to review new and existing

products and services that the organization or business offers to determine

how they could be used to launder money or finance terrorism. The

compliance officer should be an active participant in project teams that

identify appropriate control frameworks for new products and systems.

What products and services does your institution offer that might be

vulnerable to money laundering or terrorist financing? Internet accounts?

Private banking? Money transmittal services? Stock brokerage services?

Annuities? Insurance products? Offshore services? Money orders?

Correspondent banking?

This risk rating, based on the type of product the customer seeks, is calculated

using several product-related factors. Most notably, it depends on the

likelihood that the product requested might be used for money laundering or

terrorist financing. Interest-rate swaps are not likely to be used to finance

terror, but securities might be vulnerable. Product scoring is not universal,
because different financial organizations face varying degrees of risk.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

When assessing the AML/CFT risks of products and services, consider

whether they:

•  Enable significant volumes of transactions to occur rapidly

•  Allow the customer to engage in transactions with minimal oversight by

the organization

•  Afford significant levels of anonymity to the users

•  Have an especially high transaction or investment value

•  Allow payments to third parties

•  Have unusual complexity

•  Require government verification of customer eligibility

In addition, certain banking functions and products are considered high risk,

including:

•  Private banking

•  Offshore international activity

•  Deposit-taking facilities

•  Wire transfer and cash-management functions

•  Transactions in which the primary beneficiary is undisclosed

•  Loan guarantee schemes

•  Travelers checks

•  Official bank checks

•  Money orders

•  Foreign exchange transactions

•

International remittances

•  Payment services such as payment processors, prepaid products,

automatic clearing house

•  Remote deposit capture

•  Trade-financing transactions with unusual pricing features

•  Payable through accounts

AML/CFT risk identification (Case example:
Failure to identify high-risk activity)

In September 2020, Westpac Banking Corporation agreed to a penalty of

AUD$1.3 billion for over 23 million breaches of Australia’s Anti-Money

Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) Act. The financial
regulator Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC)

launched legal action against Westpac in November 2019, for failing to detect
and report nearly 3,000 transactions that suggested activity linked to child

exploitation.

AUSTRAC accused Westpac of systemic financial crime control failures. In

2016, senior managers were alerted to the risk of suspicious payments using

its low-value payment service, LitePay. Westpac did not implement controls to

detect illicit activity using LitePay for two years.

According to AUSTRAC, Westpac failed to monitor customers whose activities

indicated child exploitation, did not identify typologies that were indicative of

child exploitation, did not apply them to transaction monitoring systems, and

did not carry out appropriate customer due diligence for suspicious

transactions associated with possible child exploitation.

By May 2016 Westpac had determined that the child exploitation risks relating

to low-value payments to the Philippines were increasing. In response, it

introduced a detection scenario to one of its payment channels that failed to

detect any issues. The detection test was replaced by another in June 2018

that was an appropriate analytical tool but it was applied to only one payment
channel, LitePay.

Twelve customers were identified with links to the Philippines and Southeast

Asia, which are high. Eleven of them had activity patterns of frequent, low-

value transactions that were consistent with child exploitation typologies. One

customer had a prior conviction for child sexual exploitation, which should

have triggered EDD by the bank. Six of the individuals regularly traveled to the

Philippines and Southeast Asia.

AUSTRAC alleged that, if Westpac had conducted appropriate due diligence

and in particular applied appropriate detection tools for child exploitation

typologies, these customers would have been identified earlier. AUSTRAC

found that Westpac had also failed to adequately assess high-risk

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 253

Version 6.44

correspondent banking risks. This failure led to relationships with other banks

that held nested relationships with respondents in several sanctioned and
high-risk countries, including the DRC, Iraq, Libya, and Zimbabwe.

Key takeaways

•  Westpac did not apply the correct typologies or monitoring tools to detect

payments linked to child exploitation, even when the risks had been
identified.

•  Westpac did not have a consistent and clear understanding of its AML/CFT

risk and how it should be managed and mitigated.

•  Westpac’s control failures extended to other high-risk areas such as

correspondent banking.

AML/CFT Program

The Elements of an AML/CFT Program

Commonly referred to as the four pillars, the basic elements of an effective
AML/CFT program are:

•  A system of internal policies, procedures, and controls (first line of

defense)

•  A designated compliance function with a compliance officer (second line

of defense)

•  An ongoing employee training program

•  An independent audit function to test the overall effectiveness of the AML

program (third line of defense)

Although CDD requirements have traditionally been encompassed in the

system of internal controls, FATF focuses particular attention on CDD as a

critical means of mitigating AML/CFT risk. Under a 2016 rule, FinCEN

established a fifth pillar that requires appropriate, risk-based procedures for

conducting ongoing CDD, raising the prominence of this critical aspect of

AML/CFT programs to its own pillar.

These procedures include:

•  Understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the

purpose of developing a customer risk profile

•  Conducting ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious

transactions

•  Maintaining and updating customer information

The AML/CFT legislation in a number of countries identifies the mandatory

elements of an AML/CFT program. Organizations should ensure that all such

elements are addressed, based on the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions

in which they operate.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 255

Version 6.44

A System of Internal Policies, Procedures,
and Controls

The establishment and continual development of a financial organization’s

policies, procedures, and controls are foundational to a successful AML/CFT

program. Together, these three parts define and support the entire AML/CFT
program. At the same time, they serve as a blueprint that outlines how an

organization fulfills its regulatory requirements. All three parts should be
designed to mitigate the identified AML/CFT risks and should take into

account the applicable AML/CFT laws and regulations with which the financial

organization must comply. They should clearly indicate the risk appetite of the
business, that is, which risks the business is prepared to accept and which it is

not.

Although these controls are typically applied by the first line of defense (i.e.,

the employees who are responsible for onboarding customers), every

employee throughout a financial organization, at all levels of the organization,

must contribute to the creation, maintenance, and overall success of the

AML/CFT program.

In large financial organizations, there is a critical need to adopt an enterprise-

wide approach that allows for consistency in the manner in which the financial

organization manages its ML/TF risk. However, there is also a need to

accommodate regional and/or business line-specific requirements. For

example, enterprise-wide ML/TF risk models in financial organizations that

operate in multiple regions and/or countries need to reflect the local

regulatory requirements. This can be achieved by having a different version of

the AML/CFT program or by having country-specific addenda to the global

AML/CFT program.

Internal AML/CFT policies should be established and approved by executive

management and the board of directors, which sets the tone for the

organization. Although the organization’s policy may be a high-level statement

of principles, it serves as the basis for procedures and controls that detail how

lines of business will achieve compliance with laws, regulations, and the
organization’s AML/CFT policies.

The standard AML/CFT operating procedures should be drafted at the

operational level in the financial organization. These procedures must be

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 256

Version 6.44

modified and updated, as needed, to reflect changes in laws and regulations,

products, and the organization itself. These procedures are more detailed
than the corresponding AML/CFT policies; they translate policy into

acceptable and workable practices. The procedures also form the basis of an
important component of AML/CFT training, and the compliance monitoring

programs. In addition to policies and procedures, organizations need a

process to support and facilitate effective implementation of procedures,
which should be reviewed and updated regularly.

Although policies and procedures provide important guidance, the AML/CFT

program also relies on a variety of internal controls, including management
reports and other built-in safeguards that keep the program working. These

internal controls should enable the compliance department to recognize
deviations from standard procedures and safety protocols. A matter as simple

as requiring a corporate officer’s approval or two signatures for transactions

that exceed a prescribed amount could be a critical internal control element

that, if ignored, seriously weakens an organization’s AML/CFT program and

attracts unwanted attention from supervisory authorities.

Similarly, a second review and approval of actions considered to be

departures from policy could be helpful when subsequent questions arise.

Other effective controls use technology, such as account opening systems

that force the entry of required information, aggregation systems that detect

reportable currency transactions, and automated account monitoring

programs.

AML policies, procedures, and controls

An AML/CFT compliance program should be in writing and include policies,

procedures, and controls that are designed to prevent, detect, and deter

money laundering and terrorist financing, including how the organization will:

•

Identify high-risk operations (products, services, delivery channels,

customers, and geographic locations/jurisdictions).

•  Periodically update its risk profile and provide for an AML/CFT compliance

program tailored to manage risks.

•

Inform the board of directors (or a committee of the board) and senior

management of compliance initiatives, known compliance deficiencies,
SARs filed, and corrective actions taken.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 257

Version 6.44

•  Develop and maintain a system of metrics reporting that provides accurate
and timely information on the status of the AML/CFT program, including
statistics on key elements of the program, such as the number of

transactions monitored, alerts generated, cases created, and SARs filed.

•  Assign clear accountability to people for performance of duties under the

AML/CFT program.

•  Provide for program continuity, despite changes in management,

employee composition, or structure.

•  Meet all regulatory requirements and recommendations for AML/CFT

compliance.

•  Provide for periodic review and timely updates to implement changes in

regulations, at least on an annual basis.

•

Implement risk-based CDD policies, procedures, and processes.

•  Provide for dual controls and segregation of duties.

•  Comply with all recordkeeping requirements, including retention and

retrieval of records.

•  Provide sufficient controls and monitoring systems for the timely detection

and reporting of potentially suspicious activity and large transaction

reporting. This should also include a procedure for recording the rationale

for not reporting activity as a result of the findings of any investigation.

•  Establish clear accountability lines and responsibilities to ensure that there
is appropriate and effective oversight of staff who engage in activities that

might pose an AML/CFT risk.

•  Establish training requirements and standards to ensure that employers

are made aware of and have a working understanding of the procedures

to be followed and their relevance to mitigating AML/CFT risks in their

departments or areas of responsibilities.

•  Clearly explain the importance of reporting suspicious activity, including
describing how and to whom concerns should be raised, the role of the

compliance officer, and what the “tipping off” restriction means in practice.

•

Incorporate into all job descriptions and performance review processes

the requirement to comply at all times with AML policies and procedures.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 258

Version 6.44

Noncompliance should be addressed in accordance with existing

disciplinary processes.

•  Develop and implement screening programs to ensure high standards
when hiring employees. Implement appropriate disciplinary actions for
employees who consistently fail to perform in accordance with an

AML/CFT framework.

•  Develop and implement quality assurance testing programs to assess the

effectiveness of the AML/CFT program’s implementation and execution of

its requirements. This is separate from the independent audit requirement,

but it serves a similar purpose—to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the
program.

The level of sophistication a financial organization needs to maintain

concerning its policies, procedures, and controls directly correlates to its size,

structure, risk, and complexity of products, among other factors. Failure to

establish, perform, follow, and maintain adequate policies, procedures, and

controls can lead to severe enforcements against the organization or

designated individuals involved.

Highlights of and Differences between AML/CFT Policies, Procedures, and
Controls

Policies

•  Clear and simple high-level statements that are
uniform across the entire organization (set the
tone from the top)

•  Approved by executive management or the board

of directors

•  Reflect the high-level responsibilities of the
stakeholders throughout the organization

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 259

Version 6.44

Procedures

•  Translate the AML/CFT policies into an acceptable
and workable practice, tasking the stakeholders
with their respective responsibilities

•  The instructions for how an organization wants

something done

•  Typically established at the operational (not
executive) level of the financial institution

•  Much more detailed than AML policies

•  Reviewed and updated regularly

Controls

•  The internal technology or tools the financial

organization uses to ensure the AML/CFT program
is functioning as intended and within predefined
parameters

•  Alert compliance department to potential outliers
and deviations from normal policy that may need
to be reviewed

•

Includes management reports, automated review
systems, and the utilization of multiple reviewers

A system of internal policies, procedures,
and controls (Case example: Lack of overall
policy control and oversight)

In October 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) revoked the

license of the Singapore branch of Falcon Bank Limited, due to AML/CTF

failures. In 2015, an MAS investigation found that the bank’s AML/CTF failings

had significantly worsened following a previous inspection. One particularly

serious infraction involved an individual linked to the 1Malaysia Development

Berhad (1MDB) scandal and was facilitated by the actions of a former member

of senior management.

MAS determined that the failings could not be rectified and ordered the

closure of the branch. It also issued a fine of SGD 4.3 million, about US$3.2

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 260

Version 6.44

million for 14 breaches of AML/CTF regulations. The Singapore branch

manager was sentenced to 28 weeks in jail and personally fined SGD 128,000,
about US$94,000.

MAS had first identified AML/CFT failings with Falcon Bank following an
inspection in 2013. At that time, it fined the bank and ordered it to correct its

AML/CTF control deficiencies in client onboarding and transaction monitoring.

When MAS conducted a follow-up inspection in 2015, it found that, instead of
rectifying its deficiencies, the situation had deteriorated.

Between 2012 and mid-2015, the bank’s managers approved US$3.8 billion

(SGD 5.2 billion) of asset transfers linked to the 1MDB fund. Despite the
identification of red flags in these payments, the transactions were processed

at the urging of senior management who coerced them to process the
unusually large payments.

The Singapore branch manager was accused of failing to take action on more

than SGD 1.3 billion or US$1 billion in payments linked to 1MDB. He was also

accused of lying about his links to the alleged mastermind of the 1MDB money

flows out of Malaysia. The court stated that his sentence was intended to be a

deterrent to other bankers.

This case illustrates the need for an effective second line of defense.

Compliance staff must provide adequate and effective challenge to the

business and senior management when their actions directly or indirectly

facilitate money laundering. Regulators may impose fines and imprisonment

upon staff who have willfully participated in money laundering activity.

Key takeaways

•  Falcon Bank failed to remedy its AML/CTF control deficiencies, and

regulators found the situation got progressively worse.

•  Senior management exerted influence to facilitate transactions that were

flagged as suspicious and unusually large.

•  The sentencing of the Singapore branch manager was intended to be a

deterrent to other bankers.

A system of internal policies, procedures,
and controls (Case example: PEP risks)

In April 2017, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) fined the Hong Kong

branch of Coutts & Co AG HKD 7 million. HKMA determined the bank failed to

identify clients who were politically exposed persons (PEPs) due to a lack of
effective policies and procedures. Contributing to the ineffective control

framework were multiple systemic failings. These included only partial
screening of customers, lack of action on screening alerts, delays in obtaining

senior management approvals for customer relationships with PEPs, and

undisclosed customer due diligence (CDD) failures.

Following the fine, Coutts cooperated with HKMA and adopted remedial

measures to address the deficiencies.

HKMA determined that, between 2012 and 2015, Coutts failed to establish

effective procedures for identifying PEPs in its customer base, including

beneficial owners. This deficiency prevented PEPs from being identified by
the bank, even when relevant information was publicly available.

HKMA found that Coutts had subscribed to a commercially available PEP

database that generated alerts during screening, but they were not promptly

addressed. HKMA found four instances of PEPs who were not identified or

classified as high-risk customers, despite publicly available information.

Coutts also failed to establish effective procedures for ensuring follow-up on

PEP alerts. It did not establish a management information system to oversee

the approval process with senior management to continue relationships with

PEPs. This violated HKMA regulatory requirements for PEP relationships to be

approved. In one case, it took 34 months to obtain management approval for

a PEP relationship.

Coutts limited PEP screening to new customers. There was no ongoing

screening for existing customers. In addition, HKMA found deficiencies in

Coutts’ periodic and event-driven reviews. HKMA identified nine PEPs without

management approvals, of which five had generated alerts that were not

promptly addressed.

Coutts cooperated fully with the HKMA investigation. Coutts independently

hired a consultant to remediate the identified customer files and review the

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 262

Version 6.44

deficiencies in their policies and procedures. These actions reduced the

penalty paid by an undisclosed amount.

Key takeaways

•  Effective policies and procedures for PEPs require an effective control

framework based on local regulations.

•  PEP screening should be conducted throughout the customer relationship.
PEP policies and procedures need to explicitly and clearly direct when

screening takes place. It should not be left open to interpretation.

•  Controls for screening alerts and management approvals need to be

consistently followed.

•

Ineffective screening for PEPs and associated procedures can result in

regulatory failings.

The Compliance Function

An organization’s compliance function is commonly referred to as the second

line of defense. It is responsible for monitoring the controls of the business,

which is the first line of defense. The compliance function cannot be designed

with a “one size fits all” mentality. Regardless of the structure, however, the

role of the second line of defense must be established in a manner that

ensures it can fulfill its role effectively.

The sophistication of the compliance function should be based on the

organization’s nature, size, complexity, regulatory environment, and the

specific risks associated with its products, services, and customers. No two

organizations will have exactly the same compliance structure, because the

risks facing each organization are different, as identified in their respective risk
assessments.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 263

Version 6.44

The Designation and Responsibilities of a
Compliance Officer

In most cases, the board of directors is responsible for appointing a qualified

individual as the organization’s AML/CFT compliance officer. This individual is

responsible for managing all aspects of the AML/CFT compliance program.
This includes, but is not limited to, designing and implementing the program,

making necessary changes and updates, disseminating information about the
program’s successes and failures to key staff members, constructing

AML/CFT-related content for staff training programs, and managing the

organization’s adherence to applicable AML/CFT laws and regulations,
including staying current on legal and regulatory developments in the field.

Communication

The ability of the compliance officer to communicate effectively, both in

writing and verbally, is vital to the success of an organization’s AML/CFT

program. The compliance officer must also have the means to communicate

at all levels of the organization—from frontline associates up to the CEO and

board of directors.

It is critical for a compliance officer to be capable of articulating matters of

importance to senior and executive management, particularly significant

changes that could present risk to the organization, such as a sudden or

substantial increase in SARs or currency transaction reports (CTRs). Other

items of concern that should be escalated to management include changes

to laws and regulations that might require immediate action. A compliance

officer must have the skills necessary to be able to analyze and interpret these

ongoing changes, determine what effect they may have on the organization,
and recommend an action plan, when appropriate.

In many countries, the AML/CFT officer must also have a direct reporting line

to the board or equivalent body. This unfettered access to board members

allows him or her to undertake this oversight role in an effective manner.

Depending upon the country, different reporting lines may exist.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

Delegation of AML duties

The specific delegation of tasks and responsibilities within an AML/CFT

department varies among organizations. The department could potentially be

organized into subgroups with, for example, one person responsible for
strategic aspects of the program and another for its operational aspects,

including suspected money laundering monitoring and reporting suspicious
activity.

Examples of AML/CFT subgroups include:

•  Program Management

o  Manages and coordinates regulatory examinations
o  Performs periodic reviews and updates of the program
o  Coordinates implementation activities with the lines of business and
support groups to ensure that applicable business procedures are

updated to incorporate program changes

o  Monitors regulatory environment for changes to the program
o  Helps prepare training materials and provides guidance and advice on
complicated AML/CFT issues not addressed by the line of business

support group

•  Know Your Customer

o  Assigns a risk code to all clients based on scoring of the CDD risk

assessment

o  Performs additional due diligence on medium- and high-risk customers
identified via the CDD process and customers seeking certain products

and services from the financial organization

o  Provides a first line of contact for line-of-business questions on

AML/CFT matters

•  Sanctions Screening

o  Manages sanctions screening software applications and processes
o  Monitors and reconciles the data being received from the source

systems

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 265

Version 6.44

o  Fine-tunes the filter thresholds according to changes in the risk profile

of the organization

o  Reviews suspected matches and reports valid matches to the

appropriate regulatory authorities

•  Transaction Monitoring

o  Manages transaction monitoring software applications
o  Monitors and reconciles the data being received from the source

systems

o  Fine-tunes the filter thresholds according to changes in the risk profile

of the organization

o  Participates in the design of transaction monitoring typologies and

maintains the extensive documentation required

•  Financial Investigations

o  Monitors alerts generated on customer transactions, such as those
from automated systems and referrals from line-of-business staff.

Investigates alerts and referrals

o
o  Files SARs with the appropriate FIU, as required

In addition to these groups, other employees conduct AML/CFT tasks in the

business lines wherever there is customer contact. For example, CDD forms

are often completed by account officers and other staff members when a

new account is opened, while branch personnel participate in periodic

reviews of high-risk customers and might be required to provide additional

information or explanation to support investigations into potentially suspicious

activity. Sometimes, suspicious activity is reported to the corporate security

group, which, upon determining that the activity might pose an AML/CFT risk,

might refer the case to the financial investigations group.

The compliance department might also direct AML/CFT-related compliance

efforts as a result of instructions from a regulatory authority or research

findings. The business and the compliance function might establish risk-based

quality assurance reviews and monitoring and testing activities to ensure the

functions are being performed appropriately. This could include reviewing the
CDD collected to ensure completeness, monitoring reports of CDD

completeness or defects to ensure the systems are working as expected and

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 266

Version 6.44

performing tests to assess whether the monitoring and the business

performance are satisfactorily measuring and ensuring compliance.

Compliance officer accountability

Regardless of the way an organization delegates its various AML/CFT tasks, its
designated compliance officer is responsible for executing the AML/CFT

program (i.e., ultimate responsibility lies with the board of directors). More and
more often, various regulators are seeking enforcement actions against not

only the organization, its executive management team, and board of directors

for AML/CFT violations, but the compliance officer as well.

Compliance officer accountability (Case
example: US bank)

In March 2020, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US

Department of the Treasury imposed a US$450,000 civil money penalty

against Michael LaFontaine, former chief operational risk officer (CRO) at US

Bank National Association (US Bank). LaFontaine was fined for his shared

responsibility in failing to prevent violations of US anti-money laundering (AML)

laws and regulations that occurred during his tenure.

LaFontaine held senior positions in US Bank's AML department from 2005 to

2014. According to FinCEN, his roles involved progressively more responsibility

over time.

Regulators are increasingly holding senior management personally

accountable for their organizations’ violations of AML regulations and failure to

act accordingly.

In his position as US Bank’s CRO, LaFontaine reported directly to the bank’s

chief executive officer and communicated directly with its board of directors.

His primary responsibilities included overseeing US Bank's AML compliance

department and supervising the bank’s chief compliance officer, AML officer,

and AML staff. Due to his oversight responsibility, FinCEN determined that
LaFontaine shared responsibility for US Bank's AML violations.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 267

Version 6.44

He failed to:

•

Implement and maintain an adequate AML program

•  Adequately staff the compliance program with sufficient resources to

execute their regulatory expectations

•  File suspicious activity reports (SARs) in a timely manner, including on

transactions that potentially laundered the proceeds of crimes

FinCEN concluded that LaFontaine knew US Bank’s inadequate policies,
procedures, and controls would result in its failure to investigate and report

suspicious and potentially illegal activity. In addition, it noted that LaFontaine

failed to exercise the responsibilities for monitoring and reporting suspicious
activity by:

•

Imposing upper limits on the number of alerts produced by the institution’s

automated transaction monitoring system

•  Failing to subject Western Union money transfers to the monitoring system

•

Inadequately identifying and monitoring high-risk customers in compliance

with the bank secrecy act

According to FinCEN, LaFontaine was advised of the staffing issues and alert

capping through internal memos. Staff claimed that significant increases in

SAR volumes, law enforcement inquiries, and account closure

recommendations created a situation in which AML staff resources were

“stretched dangerously thin.” La Fontaine failed to investigate and address the

deficiencies within the department. This case illustrates the dangers of willful

blindness, or deliberately ignoring and refusing to address or escalate
violations.

Version 6.44

Key takeaways

•  Compliance departments should be adequately staffed to meet regulatory

requirements.

•  Compliance officers should escalate and act upon internal warnings and

identified risks.

•  Compliance officers are increasingly held personally liable for wrongdoing

and may be prosecuted.

•  Compliance officers should always act with integrity and do what is in the

best interest of the organization.

•  Compliance officers must understand their legal obligations and act in the

spirit and letter of the law.

Compliance officer accountability (Case
example: Personal liability)

In October 2020, the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)

assessed a $60 million civil penalty against Ohio resident Larry Dean Harmon.

Harmon was the founder and primary operator of the convertible virtual

currency businesses Helix and Coin Ninja. Because he failed to designate a

compliance officer, Harmon was the de facto compliance officer and held

accountable for the organizations’ compliance failures.

From 2014 through 2017, Helix and Coin Ninja operated as unregistered money

services businesses (MSBs), offering anonymous convertible currency

exchange services for bitcoin holders. Their customers included narcotics

traffickers, counterfeiters, fraudsters, and child exploitation websites. FinCEN

determined that Harmon failed to register his businesses as MSBs, implement

and maintain an effective AML program, and report suspicious activity.

FinCEN determined that Harmon willfully violated Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)

registration and reporting requirements. Helix and Coin Ninja provided

“mixers” or “tumblers,” allowing customers, for a fee, to send bitcoin to

designated recipients in a manner that was designed to conceal the source or

owner of the bitcoin.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 269

Version 6.44

Harmon knowingly obscured the nature and identity of customer transactions

by:

•  Designing Helix to “break the blockchain” by taking bitcoin from the user’s
wallet and giving the user new bitcoin from a different pool that could not
be traced back to the user

•  Failing to collect and verify customers’ names, addresses, or identifiers on

over 1.2 million transactions

•  Failing to collect customer or transaction due diligence information for

over US$311 million in transactions

•  Deleting customer information after seven days and allowing customers to

manually delete their logs

FinCEN found that Harmon actively aided cybercriminals by concealing the

nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the proceeds of online drug

sales and other online illegal activities. MSBs are required to develop and

maintain an AML program commensurate with the risks posed by its location,

size, nature, and volume of transactions. Harmon failed to implement a system

of internal controls, designate a compliance officer to oversee the BSA

program, provide appropriate BSA training to personnel, and provide for an

independent review of the BSA program. FinCEN identified at least 2,400

instances in which Harmon failed to file a SAR on suspicious Helix transactions.

The US Department of Justice held Harmon accountable for unlawful money

laundering practices. Harmon pled guilty to criminal charges for money

laundering and agreed to the forfeiture of 4,400 bitcoin as part of his plea. He
may be subject to imprisonment, fines, and other restrictions.

Key takeaways

AML/CFT Training

Components of an effective training program

Most AML/CFT laws and regulations require financial organizations to offer as

part of their formalized AML/CFT compliance programs training for relevant

employees. Training is one of the most important ways to emphasize the

importance of AML/CFT efforts, as well as educating employees about what

to do if they encounter potential money laundering. Training also serves as an

important control in the mitigation of money laundering risks to which the
financial organization might be exposed.

An effective training program should not only explain the relevant AML/CFT

laws and regulations, but also cover the organizations’ policies and

procedures used to mitigate money laundering risks. In this section, the term

training includes both formal training courses and ongoing communications

that serve to educate employees and maintain their ongoing awareness

about AML/CFT requirements, such as emails, newsletters, periodic team

meetings, intranet sites, and other means of sharing information. Following is

an explanation of who should receive AML/CFT training, the topics that should

form the basis of that training, and how, when, and where that training should

be delivered.

Who to train

The first step in designing an effective AML/CFT training program is to identify

the target audience. Most areas of the financial organization should receive

AML/CFT training. In particular, new staff members should receive training

during employee orientation or shortly thereafter. In some countries, training

programs must extend beyond full- or part-time employees to include

contractors, consultants, students, apprentice placements, and secondees

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 271

Version 6.44

from other branches or subsidiaries. Each segment of the staff should be

trained on AML/CFT topics and issues that are relevant to their activities.

Example: Scope of Training

•  Customer-facing staff: This is the financial organization’s first line of

defense; these employees need the deepest practical understanding of

why AML/CFT efforts are important and what they need to do to be vigilant

against money laundering. Although a general course will often be
sufficient to address the importance of AML and provide some basics,

additional training on specific unit procedures related to the products and

services carried out by the business line is often needed. For example,
loans, credit, and loan-operations staff need training on how money

launderers might misuse credit products, how the staff can recognize

potential money laundering, and what the staff must do if they see it. Cash

handlers often need special training because many jurisdictions have

imposed additional requirements to address the increased risk posed by

cash. These employees need to know how to properly handle cash

transactions, especially those that trigger reporting requirements,

including when to escalate concerns when a customer attempts to

structure a transaction to avoid the reporting requirements. Employees

who establish loans and accounts for new customers need to know

applicable regulatory requirements and the organization’s policies and

procedures for identification and performing due diligence during the

onboarding process.

•  Operations personnel: Non-customer-facing personnel within an

organization’s lines of business are also included in the first line of defense

and should not be overlooked in the delivery of specialized training. For

example, cash vault, wire transfer, trade finance, loan underwriters, loan

collections, and treasury management personnel are often in positions to

recognize illegal, fraudulent, and unusual account activity. Specialized

training for these individuals to recognize AML/CFT red flags and elevate

unusual activity to compliance personnel should be considered.

•  AML/CFT compliance staff: Under the direction of a designated compliance

officer, the compliance staff function coordinates and monitors the

organization’s day-to-day AML/CFT compliance program. It is the second

line of defense. Given this area’s responsibility for managing the

organization’s adherence to AML/CFT regulations, more advanced

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 272

Version 6.44

ongoing training to stay abreast of requirements and emerging trends is

important. Often, this requires attending conferences or AML/CFT-specific
presentations that are more robust in nature.

•

Independent testing staff: Independent testing personnel are the
organization’s third line of defense. Because this functional area

independently assesses the adequacy of the AML/CFT compliance

program, these employees should receive periodic training concerning
regulatory requirements, changes in regulation, money laundering

methods and enforcement, and their impact on the organization.

•  Senior management and board of directors: The board and senior

management do not need the same degree of training as personnel in the

first, second, and third lines of defense. Specialized training for the

organization’s leadership should address the importance of AML/CFT

regulatory requirements, regulatory changes that impact the organization,

penalties for noncompliance, personal liability, and the organization’s

unique risks. Without a general understanding of this information, senior

management and the board cannot adequately provide for AML/CFT

oversight, approve AML/CFT policies, and provide sufficient resources.

Training topics

Another factor in designing an effective AML/CFT training program is

identifying the topics to be taught. This will vary according to the organization,

specific products and services offered, and who is being trained.

Several basic topics should be factored into AML/CFT training, including:

•  General background and history pertaining to money laundering controls,
including the definitions of money laundering and terrorist financing, why

criminals do it, and why stopping them is important

•  Legal framework on what AML/CFT laws apply to organizations and their

employees

•  New and changing regulatory requirements that affect the organization

•  Penalties for AML/CFT violations, including criminal and civil penalties, fines,
jail terms, as well as internal sanctions, such as disciplinary action up to and

including termination of employment

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 273

Version 6.44

•

Internal policies, such as customer identification and verification

procedures and policies, including CDD, EDD, and ongoing due diligence

•  Review of the internal AML/CFT and sanctions risk assessments

•  Legal recordkeeping requirements

•  Suspicious transaction monitoring and reporting requirements

•  Currency transaction reporting requirements

•  How to react when faced with a suspicious client or transaction

•  How to respond to customers who want to circumvent reporting

requirements

•  Duties and accountability of employees

•  How to maintain confidentiality with AML-related matters

•  AML trends and emerging issues related to criminal activity, terrorist

financing, and regulatory requirements

•  Real-life money laundering schemes (preferably cases that have occurred
at the organization or at similar organizations), including how the pattern of

activity was first detected, its impact on the organization, and its ultimate

resolution

Parties responsible for designing the training must identify which of these
topics relate to the target audience.

The FCA published guidance to clarify expectations when significant AML

weaknesses persist in small banks. The guidance was based on proposed

examples of good practice from two thematic reviews that the FCA and its

predecessor conducted. Among other issues, the FCA questioned the

effectiveness of training programs, which often lacked specificity related to

organizations’ unique risks.

Training best practices published in the guidance included the following:

•  Appropriate training tailored to the individual’s specific roles. Roles lacking
specific training included the following areas: offshore centers, mortgage

lending, areas servicing PEPs and other high-risk clients, investment banks,

and trade finance. Generic training is considered to be acceptable,

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 274

Version 6.44

provided it is supplemented with specific training with a practical

application to the specific line of business or role within the organization.

•  Periodic refresher training—usually annually—is important for existing

employees.

•  Banks should assess whether third parties and employees working in

outsourced functions need to attend specific AML training.

How to train

Following are steps that trainers can take to ensure an effective AML/CFT

training program:

•

Identify the issues that must be communicated and decide how best to

disseminate the message. Sometimes a memo or email will accomplish

what is needed without formal, in-person training. Sometimes, e-learning

can efficiently communicate the information. Other times, classroom

training is the best option.

•

Identify the audience by functional area and by level of

employee/management. This can be accompanied by a brief “Why are

they here?” assessment. New hires should receive training that is different

from that given to veteran employees.

•  Determine the needs that should be addressed. There may be issues

uncovered by audits or regulatory examinations, or created by changes to

systems, products, or regulations.

•  Determine who can best develop and present the training program.

•  Determine if “Train the Trainer” sessions are necessary, when

decentralized training is involved (e.g., across large branch networks).

•  Create a course abstract or curriculum that addresses course goals,

objectives, and the desired results. Be sure to identify who the audience

should be and how the material will be presented.

•  To the extent possible, establish a training calendar that identifies the

topics and frequency of each course.

•  Consider whether to provide handouts. The purpose of most training
handouts is to reinforce the message of the training and provide a

reference tool after the training.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 275

Version 6.44

•  Tests should be considered as a way to evaluate how well the training is

understood, with a mandatory passing score. Employee scores should be
retained. Similarly, if a case example is used to illustrate a point, provide a

detailed discussion of the preferred course of action.

•  Attention span is a factor to consider. Focus on small, easy-to-digest, and

easy-to-categorize issues.

•  Track employee attendance. Ask attendees to sign in and issue reminders
if make-up sessions are needed. Unexcused absences might warrant

disciplinary action and notation in employee personnel files.

When to train

An organization’s training should be ongoing and on a regular schedule.

Existing employees should at least attend an annual training session. New

employees should receive appropriate training with respect to their job

function and within a reasonable period after joining the organization or

transferring to a new position. Situations may arise that demand an immediate

session or enhanced training beyond the basic training program. For example,

an emergency training session might be necessary right after an examination

or audit that uncovers serious money laundering control deficiencies, a news

story that names the organization, or recent regulatory action, such as a

consent order, which might also prompt quick-response training. Changes in

software, systems, procedures, and regulations are additional triggers for

training sessions, as well as specific money laundering or other illicit financial
activity risks that impact a specific business line or department.

Where to train

Some organizations have training centers that allow trainees to escape the

distractions of daily work activity. Some types of training are more effective

when conducted in small groups, such as the evaluation of a money

laundering Case example. Role-playing exercises, which may be used to

complement a prepared lecture or panel discussions, are also more effective

in small groups. These training sessions can be held anywhere. Large groups

can be trained using computer-based training courses, which can be

designed to automatically record attendance and test attendees, with a

required minimum score to demonstrate understanding of the material.

AML/CFT training (Case example)

On February 25, 2016, FinCEN and the Office of the Comptroller of the

Currency (OCC) coordinated enforcement actions against Gibraltar Private
Bank & Trust Company in Coral Gables, Florida, for willful AML compliance

violations. The bank’s substantial AML program violations, which included

failure to properly train compliance staff, led to a US$2.5 million civil money
penalty assessed by the OCC and a US$4 million civil money penalty assessed

by FinCEN.

From 2009 to 2014, the bank’s implementation of AML training was inadequate

and not tailored to the needs of specific positions, departments, board

members, or other personnel. For example, in 2009, senior bank officials took

a basic AML course specifically designed for bank tellers, which was not

appropriate, considering their functional responsibilities. In May 2013, a training

assessment was undertaken by management that identified the need for

significant training to adequately implement the bank’s AML program. Over

one year later, in 2014, regulatory authorities found that the bank had still not
addressed any of the needs identified in its 2013 assessment.

Key takeaways

•

It is critical that AML training be role-specific and focused on the duties and

financial crime risk exposure of relevant staff.

•  Senior officials and board members do not need to be trained in carrying

out business functions, but they do need to understand AML requirements,

penalties for noncompliance, and how to interpret risk reporting.

•  Regulated firms can be heavily penalized for failing to implement adequate
AML training, especially when known gaps are not addressed in a timely

manner.

Version 6.44

Independent Audit

Evaluating an AML/CFT program

Establishing an AML/CFT compliance program is not enough. The program
must be monitored and evaluated. Organizations should assess their AML/CFT

programs regularly to ensure their effectiveness and look for new risk factors.

The audit must be independent (i.e., performed by people not involved with

the organization’s AML/CFT compliance staff), and individuals conducting the

audit should report directly to the board of directors or to a designated board
committee composed primarily or completely of outside directors. The

individuals performing the audit must be sufficiently qualified to ensure that

their findings and conclusions are reliable, including having knowledge and

expertise of AML/CFT. Depending on the jurisdiction, an independent audit

might also be referred to as an independent test or review.

The independent audit should do the following:

•  Assess the overall integrity and effectiveness of the AML/CFT compliance

program, including policies, procedures, and processes.

•  Assess the adequacy of the AML/CFT risk assessment.

•  Examine the adequacy of CDD policies, procedures, and processes,

including whether they comply with regulatory requirements.

•  Determine personnel adherence to the organization’s AML/CFT policies,

procedures, and processes.

•  Perform appropriate transaction testing, with particular emphasis on high-

risk operations (products, services, customers and geographic

locations/jurisdictions).

•  Assess training adequacy, including its comprehensiveness, accuracy of

materials, training schedule, attendance tracking, and escalation

procedures for lack of attendance.

•  Assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations based on the

jurisdictions in which the organization does business.

•  Examine the integrity and accuracy of management information systems
used in the AML/CFT compliance program. If applicable, this includes

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 278

Version 6.44

assessing the adequacy of the scope of any third-party independent

system validations and the qualifications of parties engaged to perform
such reviews.

•  Review all the aspects of any AML/CFT compliance functions that have
been outsourced to third parties, including the qualifications of the

personnel, contract, performance, and reputation of the company.

•  Evaluate the ability of transaction monitoring software application to

identify unusual activity by:

o  Reviewing policies, procedures, and processes for suspicious activity

monitoring

o  Reviewing the processes for ensuring the completeness, accuracy, and
timeliness of the data supplied by the source transaction processing

systems

o  Evaluating the methodology for establishing and analyzing expected

activity and filtering criteria

o  Evaluating the appropriateness of the monitoring reports
o  Comparing the transaction monitoring typologies with the AML/CFT risk

assessment for reasonableness

•  Review case management and SAR systems, including an evaluation of the

research and referral of unusual transactions and a review of policies,

procedures, and processes for referring unusual and suspicious activity

from all business lines to the personnel responsible for investigating it.

•  Assess the effectiveness of the organization’s policy for reviewing

accounts that generate multiple SAR filings, including account closure

processes.

•  Assess the adequacy of recordkeeping and record-retention processes.

•  Track previously identified deficiencies and ensure management corrects

them promptly.

•

In coordination with the board or designated board committee, ensure

that overall audit coverage and frequency are appropriate to the risk

profile of the organization.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 279

Version 6.44

•  Consider whether the board of directors was responsive to earlier audit

findings.

•  Determine the adequacy of the following, as they relate to the training

program and materials:

o  The importance the board and senior management place on ongoing

education, training, and compliance

o  Employee accountability for ensuring AML/CFT compliance, including

the employee performance management process

o  Comprehensiveness of training, related to the risk assessment of each

individual business line

o  Training of personnel from all applicable areas of the organization
o  Frequency of training, including the timeliness of training given to new

and transferred employees

o  Coverage of internal policies, procedures, processes, and new rules and

regulations

o  Coverage of different forms of money laundering and terrorist

financing as they relate to identifying suspicious activity

o  Disciplinary actions taken for noncompliance with internal policies and

regulatory requirements

An effective internal audit department develops and maintains an audit risk

assessment to determine audit priorities. It also develops and maintains

detailed audit testing programs for every area.

All audit and regulatory recommendations for corrective action must include

tracking, the target date for completion, and the personnel responsible. When

a systemic violation is identified regarding a regulatory reporting requirement

or other regulatory issues, the organization should perform a review back to

the prior audit or examination to identify any additional issues that need to be

rectified. Regular status reports on the audit and closure of findings should be

provided to senior management and the board of directors. Supervisory

authorities may request them.

Failure to establish and maintain a reasonably designed BSA/AML compliance
program or correct a previously reported problem could result in regulatory

action, such as a cease-and-desist order against an organization. Other

Version 6.44

regulatory actions include written agreements, matters requiring attention,

and matters requiring board attention.

Independent audit (Case example: Apical
Asset Management Pte. Ltd.)

In July 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) revoked the Capital
Markets Services (CMS) license of Apical Asset Management Pte. Ltd.

(AAMPL) for serious breaches of MAS’ AML/CFT requirements. In this case,
MAS held the directors personally responsible. It reprimanded AAMPL’s CEO

and directors for their failure to ensure that AAMPL complied with all laws and

regulations governing its operations. The failures included the lack of both an
enterprise-wide risk assessment and an independent audit.

According to MAS, AAMPL committed serious breaches of MAS’ AML/CFT

requirements from 2013 to 2018. Specifically, AAMPL:

•  Failed to conduct an enterprise-wide AML/CTF risk assessment, resulting
in the failure to understand its overall vulnerability to financial crime risks

and develop appropriate measures to address them

•  Failed to properly assess its customers for elevated financial crime risks

•  Had deficient ongoing monitoring controls and procedures

•  Failed to assess the effectiveness of its AML/CFT controls by conducting

independent audits

This case illustrates the need for a robust, holistic AML/CTF program that

includes independent oversight to assess its effectiveness. A key component

of a risk-based approach is conducting a risk assessment to identify and

assess the financial crime risks an organization faces. This allows for

implementation of robust controls to address these risks. MAS concluded that

AAMPL did not have in place basic AML/CFT policies and procedures to
manage their risks.

AML/CFT programs also need to be independently reviewed. This allows the

organization to identify gaps and deficiencies to ensure continuous

development and improvement. Independent testing can be done by

external auditors or an internal audit function with sufficient independence

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 281

Version 6.44

from the first and second lines of defense functions. Independent internal

auditors should have sufficient skills and training to conduct AML audits. They
report directly to the board.

In the AAMPL case, an effective independent review would likely have
identified any gaps in ongoing controls. The findings of the risk assessment

would have provided the organization with the opportunity to address gaps

and breaches. Instead, the regulator discovered them and revoked the
company’s CMS license.

Key takeaways

•  A robust, holistic AML/CTF program includes independent oversight and

review.

•  An enterprise-wide risk assessment is needed to identify vulnerabilities and

allow organizations to develop effective controls.

•  Entities must assess their customers for elevated financial crime risks.

•  AML/CFT policies must be in place to manage risks.

Establishing a Culture of Compliance

Embedding a culture of compliance into the overall structure of a financial

organization is critical to the development and ongoing administration of an

effective AML/CFT program. Typically, the ultimate responsibility for the

AML/CFT compliance program rests with the organization’s board of

directors. The board and senior management must set the tone from the top

by openly voicing their commitment to the AML/CFT program, ensuring that

their commitment flows through all service areas and lines of business, and

holding responsible parties accountable for compliance.

Although creating a culture of compliance may not resolve all current or

future issues, an effective AML/CFT compliance program focused on

identifying and controlling risks is critical to the overall success of an

organization. Associates in all business units must clearly understand their

commitment to supporting the compliance program by following the rules.

Adopting a culture of compliance is the most effective way to prevent easily

identified issues from becoming systemic problems.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 282

Version 6.44

An effective AML/CFT program costs money that management might be

reluctant to spend. The compliance officer’s challenge is to convince
management that an AML/CFT program is an indispensable expense to

protect the organization and prevent legal problems and reputational harm.

As a result of FinCEN’s findings of numerous financial organizations with

AML/CFT compliance deficiencies, including with the roles of boards and

senior management, it released an advisory in August 2014. The advisory
outlined six guidelines for strengthening AML/CFT compliance culture in

financial organizations:

1.  Leadership must actively support and understand compliance efforts. The
board’s role in AML/CFT compliance consists of reviewing and approving

the overall AML/CFT program and ensuring that there is ongoing oversight.

Board members are not expected to become AML/CFT experts, nor are

they responsible for day-to-day program management. Rather, they

should be knowledgeable enough to formally approve an organization’s

AML/CFT compliance program and make sure it is adequately

implemented and maintained by staff.

The board’s oversight role also extends to the supervisor’s examination

process. Examiners routinely work with the board and management

before and during on-site exams to gauge the board’s commitment to

compliance, its understanding of the law, and its knowledge of how the

organization operates. Once an exam by a supervisor or auditor is

conducted, it is the board’s duty to ensure that any necessary corrective

action is taken. Specific duties can be delegated, but the board is

responsible if problems cited by the examiner or auditor are not corrected.

Efforts to manage and mitigate AML/CFT deficiencies and risk must not be

compromised by revenue interests.

2.  Compliance staff should be empowered with sufficient authority to

implement an organization’s AML/CFT policies. Revenue interests should

not compromise or override compliance functions beyond the risk

appetite of the organization. Essentially, profit should not be prioritized

over compliance.

Relevant information from the various departments within the organization

must be shared with compliance staff to advance AML/CFT efforts.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 283

Version 6.44

3.  Business units should not remain tethered within their own individual silos.
Boundaries and barriers in communication should not exist within an
organization. Relevant information should be shared with the AML/CFT

compliance staff.

The organization must devote adequate resources to its compliance

function.

4.  In addition to the requirement to designate an individual responsible for

coordinating and monitoring day-to-day AML/CFT compliance under the

law, leadership should provide for technology resources and appropriate

AML/CFT support staff based on its risk profile.

The compliance program must be effective. One way to ensure this is by

using an independent and competent party to test the program.

5.  To be effective, an AML/CFT program must include an ongoing,

documented risk assessment and risk-based customer due diligence, and

provide for testing by an independent, unbiased, and qualified party.

6.  Leadership and staff must understand the purpose of its AML/CFT efforts
and how its SAR reporting is used. Leadership and AML/CFT staff should

understand the importance of filing regulatory reports. Per FinCEN,

properly filed reports are used “to confront serious threats, including

terrorist organizations, rough nations, weapons of mass destruction (WMD)

proliferators, foreign corruption, and, increasingly, some cyber-related

threats.”

Further emphasizing the need for a culture of compliance, the New York

State Department of Financial Services (DFS) issued Final Rule Part 504 on

June 30, 2016, requiring regulated organizations to maintain transaction

monitoring and filtering programs (TMPs) reasonably designed to:

•  Monitor transactions after their execution for compliance with the BSA
and AML laws and regulations, including suspicious activity reporting

requirements

•  Prevent unlawful transactions with targets of economic sanctions

administered by OFAC

The Final Rule, which went into effect on January 1, 2017, also requires

boards of directors or senior officer(s) of regulated organizations to make

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 284

Version 6.44

annual certifications to the DFS, confirming that they have taken all steps

necessary to comply with the TMP requirements.

Although the law may seem specific to New York, numerous foreign banks

are subject to the law because they operate in New York. Specifically, the
law covers banks, trust companies, private bankers, savings banks and

savings and loan associations chartered pursuant to the New York Banking

Law, and all branches and agencies of foreign banking corporations
licensed pursuant to the Banking Law to conduct banking operations in

New York. The law also applies to nonbank financial institutions with a

Banking Law license, such as check cashers and money transmitters.
Penalties for noncompliance are consistent with those under the Banking

Law.

Importantly, the rule establishes eight minimum requirements for TMPs, in

addition to specific core components of each program, which a financial

organization must establish and maintain under the statute:

1.

Identification of all data sources

2.  Validation of the integrity, accuracy, and quality of data

3.  Data extraction and loading processes to ensure a complete and

accurate transfer of data

4.  Governance and management oversight

5.  Vendor selection process when a third-party vendor is used

6.  Funding to design, implement, and maintain a program

7.  Qualified personnel or outside consultant

8.  Periodic training

The key to maximizing the AML/CFT unit’s usefulness is to share valuable data

with other areas of the organization, not just with law enforcement agencies,

regulators, and senior management. As AML/CFT units build their CDD files,

they might identify information other departments could use to sell products

and expand profits. For example, marketing departments that better

understand the activity of certain retail and business customers can more

effectively identify opportunities to market additional products and deepen
the overall customer relationship.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 285

Version 6.44

Before releasing customer information, it is important to review applicable

privacy laws (e.g., Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations [GDPR]) and
the firm’s privacy policy to understand any limitations. In principle, AML laws

and data privacy laws should not be mutually exclusive or contradictory. There
are usually no regulatory limits on sharing customer information with other

internal departments within the same legal entity; however, there might be

limitations on sharing with other affiliated companies within a larger
organization. Some organizations restrict the sharing of customer information

outside the organization, and customers may opt-out of the right for the

organization to provide their information to third-party companies.

Compliance staff should be sufficiently independent of the lines of business

they support so that potential conflicts of interest are minimized; they should
not be provided incentives based on the profitability of those business lines.

This does not mean that compliance staff should not receive bonuses;

however, incentives should not be structured in a way that might create a
conflict of interest.

Although the compliance staff may be situated within the line of business and

report to line management, they should have the ability to escalate issues

without fear of recrimination to a compliance or risk-management function

outside the line of business. A close working relationship of compliance staff

with the line of business is crucial to a successful execution of the AML/CFT

program. Ultimately, the compliance staff should be seen as trusted advisors

so that the business line staff will come to the compliance staff when they
have questions and will follow the advice provided.

Culture of compliance (Case example: Poor
management oversight)

In July 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) revoked the capital

markets services license of Apical Asset Management (AAM). The MAS cited

inadequate AML/CFT policies and procedures, deficient customer risk

assessments, and severe deficiencies in the control framework. It also faulted

senior management for not ensuring that asset managers followed relevant

financial crime rules and regulations. The asset managers had also failed to

undertake an enterprise-wide risk assessment (EWRA), despite an MAS

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 286

Version 6.44

requirement that the assessment be completed at least every two years.

Additionally, there was no independent audit of AAM’s controls to test their
effectiveness.

In this case, the CEO and director of AAM were specifically reprimanded for
their failings, given their ultimate responsibility for the organization’s

compliance with MAS requirements.

MAS identified several significant failings in AAM’s financial crime controls
between 2013 and 2018. These deficiencies included the lack of basic

AML/CFT controls, which put the organization at risk of receiving illicit funds.

MAS determined that this risk had been exacerbated by the nature of AAM’s
customer base, including multiple customers with complex ownership

structures.

AAM did not adequately assess its customers’ risks, and its ongoing monitoring

controls were ineffective. In one instance, a fund related to a PEP was not

subject to enhanced monitoring over an extended period of time. Increasing

the risk, there was no independent audit of AAM’s control framework to test

whether the financial crime controls were operating effectively.

Senior management must set the overall tone and develop a culture of

compliance throughout an organization. They must allocate sufficient

resources to the compliance team to enable it to function as an effective

second line of defense. Although senior managers do not need to review

every aspect of the compliance program, they must exercise sufficient

oversight of the compliance structure and processes. They also need to

review key performance indicators of how well the control framework is

functioning.

AAM’s senior management did not exercise their oversight functions to

ensure the organization complied with all applicable financial crime laws and

regulations. They did not conduct an EWRA, which MAS considers essential for

an entity to identify its financial crime risks and determine the appropriate

controls to mitigate them.

Key takeaways

•  AAM had inadequate AML/CFT policies and procedures and client risk

assessments.

•  There were severe deficiencies in the control framework and no

independent audit.

•  Accountability begins and ends with the senior management of an

organization.

•  Failures by senior management to discharge their duties can result in

systemic failings across an organization.

•  Failure to meet regulatory requirements can result in the loss of a business

license.

Know Your Customer

Customer Due Diligence

A sound CDD program is one of the most effective ways to prevent money
laundering and other financial crimes. Knowledge is what the entire AML/CFT

compliance program is built upon. The more an organization knows about its

customers, the greater chance of preventing money laundering abuses. In
fact, the US Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)

described the cornerstone of a strong AML compliance program as the

adoption and implementation of comprehensive CDD policies, procedures,

and processes for all customers, particularly those that present a higher risk

for money laundering and terrorist financing. In most cases, the typical and

basic CDD collected is sufficient. In other cases, further due diligence is

required and could be extensive. The organization’s CDD program must have

a process in place to consider each level of due diligence that might be

necessary, as well as who is responsible for collecting, verifying, and keeping

the information updated and accurate.

According to the FFIEC, the objective of CDD should be to enable the financial

organization to predict with relative certainty the types of transactions in

which a customer is likely to engage. These processes assist the financial
organization in determining when transactions are potentially suspicious.

CDD is Recommendation 10 in FATF’s updated Recommendations. FATF

recommends that financial organizations be required to undertake CDD

measures when:

•  Establishing business relationships

•  Carrying out occasional transactions under certain circumstances

•  There is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing

•  The financial organization has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of

previously obtained customer identification data

Main Elements of a Customer Due Diligence
Program

FATF recommends that organizations incorporate the following four

measures into their CDD programs:

1.

Identify the customer and verify the customer’s identity using reliable,
independent source documents, data, and information.

2.  Identify the beneficial owner and take reasonable measures to verify the

identity of the beneficial owner.

3.  Understand and, as appropriate, obtain information on the purpose and

intended nature of the business relationship.

4.  Conduct ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and scrutinize

transactions undertaken throughout the course of the relationship to

ensure that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the

organization’s knowledge of the customer, their business, risk profile, and,

when necessary, the source of funds.

A sound CDD program should include the seven elements outlined in the table

below.

Description

Customer
identification

Profiles

Obtain full identification of customer and business
entities, including source of funds and wealth, when
appropriate. The organization should ensure there is
a process in place to update and maintain current
customer information.

Develop transaction and activity profiles for each
customer. Profiles should contain sufficient
information to allow for reviews of anticipated versus
actual account activity and to otherwise enable the
organization to identify suspicious activity based on
comparing the activity with what it knows about the
customer.

Customer
acceptance

Risk rating

Monitoring

Investigation

Define and accept the customer in the context of
their use of specific products and services, which
may differ among customers and geographic
markets.

Assess and grade risks presented by the customer’s
account relationship. Numerous factors should be
considered when determining risk, including
customer type, products and services, transactional
activity, and geographic locations. No single factor
should be used to determine risk, with the exception
of a factor that constitutes an impermissible activity,
such as violating economic sanctions or illegal
activity.

Monitor accounts and transactions based on the risks
presented.

Investigate and examine unusual customer and
account activity, which should be consistent with the
anticipated activity for each customer, based on
occupation or type of business.

Documentation

Document findings as evidence or to provide a
record of actions performed. “If it is not documented,
it never happened.”

Enhanced Due Diligence

In its interpretive note to Recommendation 10, FATF acknowledges that there

are circumstances in which the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing

is higher and EDD measures must be taken. Risk factors that warrant EDD
measures include:

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 291

Version 6.44

Customer risk factors

•  Unusual circumstances regarding how the business relationship is

conducted, such as significant, unexplained geographic distance between

the financial organization and the customer

•  Nonresident customers

•  Legal persons or arrangements that are personal asset-holding vehicles

•  Companies that have nominee shareholders or shares in bearer form

•  Cash-intensive businesses

•  Unusual or excessively complex appearance of the ownership structure of

the company, given the nature of the company’s business

Country or geographic risk factors

•  Countries identified by credible sources, such as FATF’s mutual evaluations

and detailed assessment reports, as not having adequate AML/CFT

systems

•  Countries subject to sanctions, embargoes, and similar measures issued

by, for example, the United Nations

•  Countries identified by credible sources as having significant levels of drug

trafficking, corruption, financial crimes, or other criminal activity

•  Countries or geographic areas identified by credible sources as providing
funding or support for terrorist activities, or that have designated terrorist

organizations operating within them

•  Countries that share a common border and are known to have physical

cross-border transactional activity

•  Geographic areas identified as having a higher risk of money laundering or

financial crimes, such HIFCAs and HIDTAs in the United States

Product, service, transaction, and delivery channel risk factors

•  Private banking

•  Anonymous transactions (which might include cash)

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 292

Version 6.44

•  Non-face-to-face business relationships and transactions

•  Payment received from unknown or unassociated third parties

The Basel Committee, in its Sound Management of Risks Related to Money

Laundering and Terrorist Financing states that EDD may be essential for
individuals planning to maintain a large account balance and conduct regular,

cross-border wire transfers and individuals who are PEPs.

Enhanced Due Diligence for High-Risk
Customers

Customers that pose higher money laundering and terrorist financing risks

present increased exposure to financial organizations. High-risk customers

and their transactions should be reviewed even more closely at account

opening and more frequently (e.g., annually) during their account

relationships.

A financial organization should consider obtaining additional information from

high-risk customers, such as:

•  Source of funds and wealth

•

Identifying information on individuals with control over the account, such as

signatories and guarantors

•  Occupation or type of business

•  Financial statements

•  Banking references

•  Domicile

•  Proximity of the customer’s residence, place of employment, and place of

business to the bank

•  Description of the customer’s primary trade area and whether

international transactions are expected to be routine

•  Description of the business operations, the anticipated volume of currency

and total sales, and a list of major customers and suppliers

•  Explanations for changes in account activity

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 293

Version 6.44

For high-risk customers, both Wolfsberg’s Correspondent Banking Principles

and FATF recommend obtaining the approval of senior management to
commence or continue the business relationship, as well as requiring the first

payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s name with a
bank subject to similar CDD standards.

Account Opening, Customer Identification,
and Verification

A sound CDD program should have reliable customer identification and

account-opening procedures that allow the financial organization to

determine the true identity of customers. Organizations should also set

identification standards tailored to the risk posed by specific customers. In

some countries, authorities have issued specific regulations and laws that

detail what organizations are required to do regarding customer identification.

The Basel Committee’s Sound Management of Risks Related to Money

Laundering and Financing of Terrorism states that a bank should establish a
systematic procedure for identifying and verifying its customers and, when

applicable, any person acting on their behalf and any beneficial owners.

Although the committee focused on banks, its recommendations can apply to
any financial organization that opens accounts.

A bank should not establish a banking relationship or carry out any

transactions until the identity of the customer has been satisfactorily

established and verified in accordance with FATF Recommendation 10. The

identity of customers, beneficial owners, and persons acting on their behalf,

should be verified using reliable, independent source documents, data, and

information. Regulated organizations should recognize that some

identification documents are more vulnerable to fraud than others. For those

that are most susceptible to fraud, or when there is uncertainty concerning

the validity of the documents presented, the verification requirements should

be enhanced, and the information provided by the customer should be

verified through additional inquiries and other sources of information.

The Basel Committee provided guidelines for account opening and customer

identification in Annex IV General Guide to Account Opening. This document

does not address every eventuality; rather, it focuses on some methods banks

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 294

Version 6.44

can use to develop effective customer identification and verification

programs.

The annex divides customers into two groups—natural people seeking to open

an account and legal people and legal arrangements—and addresses what
types of information should be collected and verified for each.

Each new customer who is a natural person that opens a personal account

should be asked for the following information:

•  Legal name (first and last) and any other names used (e.g., maiden name,

former legal name, or alias)

•  Complete residential address and, on the basis of risk, also the business

address or post office number

•  Landline or mobile telephone numbers and email address

•  Date and place of birth

•  Gender

•  Nationality and residency status

•  Occupation, position held, and name of employer

•  An official personal identification number or other unique identifier

•  Type of account and nature of the banking relationship

•  Signature

The organization should verify this information using reliable, independently
sourced documents and data.

Documentary customer verification procedures include:

•  Confirming the identity from an unexpired official document that bears a

photograph of the customer

•  Confirming the date and place of birth from an official document

•  Confirming the validity of the official documentation through certification

by an authorized person

•  Confirming the residential address

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 295

Version 6.44

Nondocumentary customer verification procedures include:

•  Contacting the customer by telephone or letter to confirm the information

supplied after an account has been opened

•  Checking references provided by other financial organizations

•  Using an independent information verification process, such as by
accessing public registers, private databases, and other reliable

independent sources

In some jurisdictions, other documents of an equivalent nature may be

offered as satisfactory evidence of a customer’s identity.

Particular attention needs to be focused on customers who are assessed as
having high-risk profiles.

Additional sources of information and enhanced verification procedures may

include:

•  Confirming an individual’s residential address on the basis of official papers,

a credit reference agency search, or through home visits

•  Checking prior bank reference (including banking group reference) and

contacting the bank regarding the customer

•  Verifying income sources, funds, and wealth identified through appropriate

measures

•  Verifying employment and public positions held

•  Obtaining a personal reference from an existing customer of the financial

organization

If national law allows for non-face-to-face account opening, financial

organizations should take into account the specific risks associated with this

method. Customer identification and verification procedures should be

equally effective and similar to those implemented for face-to-face

interviews. As part of broader CDD measures, the organization should

consider, on a risk-sensitive basis, whether the information regarding sources
of wealth, funds, and destination of funds should be corroborated.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 296

Version 6.44

For legal people that are not natural people or legal arrangements, the

following information should be obtained:

•  Name, legal form status, and proof of incorporation of the legal person

•  Permanent address of the principal place of the legal person’s activities

•  Mailing and registered address of legal person

•

Identity of natural people who are authorized to operate the account; in

the absence of an authorized person, the identity of the relevant person
who is the senior managing official

•  Contact telephone numbers

•  Official identification number

•  Powers that regulate and bind the legal person

•

Identity of the beneficial owners

•  Nature and purpose of activities of the legal entity and its legitimacy

•  Financial situation of the entity

•  Expected use of the account—amount, number, type, purpose, and

frequency of the transactions expected—on the basis of risk; sources of

funds paid into the account; and destination of funds passing through the

account

The bank should verify the identity of the customer using reliable,

independent source documents, data, or information.

Documentary verification methods include:

•  Obtaining a copy of the certificate of incorporation, memorandum and
articles of association, partnership agreement, or any other document

certifying the existence of the entity

•  For established corporate entities, reviewing a copy of financial statements

(audited, if available)

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 297

Version 6.44

Nondocumentary verification methods include:

•  Undertaking a company search and/or other commercial inquiries to

ascertain that the legal person has not been, or is not in the process of

being, dissolved or terminated

•  Using an independent information verification process, such as by

accessing public corporate registers, private databases, or other reliable

independent sources (e.g., lawyers and accountants)

•  Validating the legal entity identifier and associated data in the public

access service

•  Obtaining prior bank references

•  Visiting the corporate entity, when practical

•  Contacting the corporate entity by telephone, mail, or email

The organization should verify that any person purporting to act on behalf of

the legal person is so authorized. If so, the organization should verify the

identity of that person as well. They should also take reasonable steps to verify

the identity of the beneficial owners. However, the exact account-opening

procedures and customer acceptance policies will depend on the type of

customer, risk, and local regulations.

After collecting and verifying customer information, the organization needs to

implement processes to maintain updated and accurate customer

information, as well as determine who is responsible for these processes, such

as the relationship manager. Outdated and inaccurate information can affect

key processes, such as EDD reviews, watchlist screening, and transaction
monitoring.

Beneﬁcial ownership structure example

ID&V (Case example: Danske Bank)

In 2007, Danske Bank acquired Finnish Sampo Bank and its Estonian branch.

Between 2007 and 2015, the Estonian branch expanded its nonresident

portfolio. Nearly all of its customers were offshore and shell companies, many

with links to high-risk countries. The parent bank was unaware of the structure

of the client portfolio, because there was no integrated client list, and it relied

on the information provided by the Estonian branch. Over an eight-year

period, approximately US$200 billion in transactions were processed by the

Estonian branch, most of which later were deemed suspicious by regulators.

The Estonian branch was closed in 2019 by order of the Estonian Financial

Supervisory Authority (FSA).

Danske Bank violated AML/CFT regulations in multiple areas. After the

acquisition of Sampo Bank, the Estonian branch was never integrated into the

group’s IT compliance infrastructure. The group-wide AML and KYC policies

and procedures were not shared with the Estonian branch. This omission led
to a fragmented and inconsistent KYC implementation within Danske Bank.

Investigators discovered that the Estonian branch employees’ understanding
of money laundering risks was limited, and there were significant deficiencies

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 299

Version 6.44

in their AML controls. The Estonian branch performed limited KYC, focused

solely on credit risk. They did not identify money laundering, terrorist financing,
sanctions, or tax evasion risks and the KYC, AML, and risk management units

were not integrated with the group.

Danske Bank failed its legal obligations and underestimated the risk of its

customer portfolio. It also failed to apply EDD measures consistent with laws

and regulations and its group-wide requirements. For example, it did not
screen incoming payments for sanctions, performed no PEP screening, and

failed to respond to suspicious customers and transactions. The suspicious

criminal activity was escalated to Danske Bank’s senior management but an
internal audit conducted by the bank did not find suspected money

laundering and no further action was taken by the bank.

AML officers must integrate their organization’s AML/CFT and KYC

frameworks across their companies, including branches and subsidiaries.

They should conduct a thorough risk assessment and ensure that appropriate

customer risk-rating methodology is implemented. Policies and procedures

must be implemented organization-wide to ensure AML/CFT and KYC

processes are robust and consistent, including the application of EDD, when

appropriate. IT systems that screen customers and identify suspicious activity

need to be integrated to support processes and risk management, including a
holistic risk view.

Key takeaways

•  Organizations must integrate the AML/CTF and KYC frameworks of new

acquisitions immediately with a thorough risk assessment.

•  Organizations should apply AML/CTF and KYC policies and procedures

organization-wide.

•  Organizations need to have a consistent customer risk-rating

methodology.

•  Organizations need to have robust and consistent KYC processes,

including EDD.

•  Dedicated AML teams should operate independent from the business.

•  A strong AML culture should be embedded across the organization with

clear oversight and direction from senior management.

Version 6.44

Consolidated Customer Due Diligence

A fragmented CDD program can significantly increase the level of money

laundering and terrorist financing risk a financial organization faces. One way
to ensure that financial organizations implement a strong CDD program is to

consolidate and streamline account opening and ongoing monitoring

processes across the organization, both domestically and globally, when
applicable.

Intergovernmental bodies have recognized the importance of implementing
a consolidated CDD process and provided specific guidance to financial

organizations. According to the Basel Committee, a global risk-management

program for CDD should incorporate consistent identification and monitoring

of customer accounts globally across business lines and geographical

locations, as well as oversight at the parent level, in order to capture instances

and patterns of unusual transactions that might otherwise go undetected.

Such comprehensive treatment of customer information can significantly

contribute to a organization’s overall reputational, concentration, operational,

and legal risk management through the detection of potentially harmful

activities.

Financial organizations should aim to apply their customer acceptance policy,

procedures for customer identification, process for monitoring high-risk

accounts, and risk-management framework on a global basis to all of their

offices, branches, and subsidiaries. The organization should clearly

communicate these policies and procedures through ongoing training and

regular communications, and it should conduct monitoring and testing to
ensure compliance with the policies and procedures.

Each office, branch, and subsidiary should be capable of complying with the

minimum identification and accessibility standards applied by the parent.

However, some differences in information collection and retention may be

necessary across jurisdictions to conform to local regulatory requirements

and relative risk factors, such as areas that pose higher levels of risk related to
money laundering, terrorist financing, and corruption.

When the minimum CDD standards of the home and host countries differ,

offices in host jurisdictions should apply the higher standard of the two. When

this is not practical, the organization should confer with its home office and

attorneys to implement appropriate and effective CDD standards.

Monitoring and Screening

Economic Sanctions

Economic sanctions are a way to influence the behavior of a jurisdiction or
group by financially isolating it as the “target.” Increasingly, countries are using

economic sanctions instead of military force as an instrument of foreign

policy.

Sanctions can generally fall into one of the following categories:

•  Targeted sanctions: Aimed at specific, named individuals, such as key
leaders in a country or territory; named terrorists; significant narcotics

traffickers; and proliferators of WMD. These sanctions often include the

freezing of assets and travel bans, when possible.

•  Sectoral sanctions: Aimed at key sectors of an economy to prohibit a very
specific subset of financial dealings within those sectors to impede future

growth

•  Comprehensive sanctions: Generally prohibit all direct and indirect

import/export, trade brokering, financing, and facilitating of most goods,

technology, and services. Comprehensive sanctions are often aimed at

regimes that are responsible for gross human rights violations and nuclear

proliferation.

Governments impose economic sanctions on state and non-state actors for

the purpose of altering the behavior that threatens the interests of the

government or violates international norms of behavior.

Most jurisdictions impose sanctions regimes, particularly to comply with

sanctions imposed by the United Nations and, for members, the European

Union. With similar goals in their application, there is expected overlap in the
sanctions applied by these bodies.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 302

Version 6.44

United Nations

UN sanctions are managed by the UN Security Council committees. The UN

Security Council can take actions to maintain and restore international peace

and security under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Sanctions
measures, under Article 41, encompass a broad range of enforcement options

that do not involve the use of armed force. Security Council sanctions take
several different forms in pursuit of a variety of goals. The measures range

from comprehensive economic and trade sanctions to more targeted

measures, such as arms embargoes, travel bans, and financial or commodity
restrictions. The Security Council applies sanctions to support peaceful

transitions, deter nonconstitutional changes, constrain and deter terrorism,

protect human rights, and promote nonproliferation.

European Union

Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides a

legal basis for the interruption or reduction, in part or completely, of the EU’s

economic and financial relations with one or more third countries (i.e.,

countries outside the EU), when such restrictive measures are necessary to

achieve the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In general

terms, the EU imposes its restrictive measures to bring about a change in

policy or activity by the target country, part of a country, government, entities,

or individuals. The measures are preventive, nonpunitive instruments that

allow the EU to respond swiftly to political challenges and developments. The

EU wields measures in support of human rights and democracy objectives in

the absence of a United Nations mandate and has supplemented UN

sanctions to stop nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea.

United States

One of the most widely known sanctions lists is OFAC’s Specially Designated

Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list. Updated often, the SDN list includes

thousands of names of individuals and businesses, as well as aircraft and ships

(vessels) from more than 150 countries, which the US government considers

to be terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and other criminals covered

by US foreign policy and trade sanctions. Similar to the UN and EU, OFAC

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 303

Version 6.44

applies sanctions to deter nonconstitutional changes, constrain and deter

terrorism, and protect human rights.

Under sanctions programs administered by OFAC, all US citizens and

companies, including foreign subsidiaries and affiliates owned or controlled by
US companies, are prohibited from providing property, or an interest in

property, to a sanctions target when a general or specific license has not been

issued. This includes individuals, companies, property, countries (e.g., North
Korea, Syria, Cuba, and Iran) that are subject to a sanctions program.

Depending on the specific program, action might involve blocking (or

freezing) a transaction or rejecting or returning a transaction.

OFAC is not a supervisory agency, but it works closely with supervisory

agencies at both the federal and state levels. During examinations of financial

organizations, supervisory examiners review OFAC compliance efforts,

including policies and procedures, training, testing, and tuning of screening

systems, to determine a financial organization’s ability to effectively detect

SDNs and entities that are sanctioned within all of OFAC’s programs—even

entities that are not specially designated—and to comply with OFAC’s

sanctions programs. If a financial organization is found to have weak OFAC

controls, is engaged in activity with an entity identified on the SDN list, or is

sanctioned under any OFAC sanctions program, federal and state examiners

and OFAC may take actions, including, but not limited to, issuing monetary

penalties, criminal penalties, and regulatory actions (e.g., Written Agreements

and Matters Requiring Attention).

The sanctions programs are governed by several laws and regulations and are

subject to change; therefore, sanctions compliance requires a specialized skill

set and constant attention to the changing nature of sanctions.

Sanctions List Screening

Before a financial organization starts doing business with a new customer or

engages in certain transactions (e.g., international wire payments), it should

review the various country sanctions program requirements, as well as

published lists of known or suspected terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and

other criminals, for potential matches.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 304

Version 6.44

Organizations subject to sanctions compliance are required to screen

customers and transaction records against periodically updated lists that
include individuals and entities designated or identified by governmental

bodies. Sanctions lists identify terrorists, terrorist organizations, and
supporters of terrorism, as well as individuals and entities subject to targeted,

sectoral, and comprehensive sanctions.

Financial organizations must be alert to transactions that involve parties
identified on a sanctions list. This can be difficult, particularly because it

involves screening customer lists for people whose names are not originally in

Roman characters, such as suspected terrorists from Middle Eastern
countries and sanctions lists in Asian countries. For example, most of the

names of designated terrorists on the OFAC SDN list also include numerous
“also known as” alternatives. Although some names might be aliases, others

are confusing because the naming conventions are not understood. An

understanding of Arab naming conventions and protocols can help alleviate
the confusion.

Below are some helpful tips:

•  All names are transliterated from an Arabic script in which short

consonants are most often omitted. For example, the name "Mohammed"

might be written on a financial account as "Mohamed" or "Mohamad."

•  Arabic names are typically long. A person’s second name is the father’s
name. A "bin" or "ibn" preceding the name indicates “son of.” If a family

name is included at the end, it will sometimes be preceded by "al."

•  There is widespread use of certain names, such as Mohamed, Ahmed, Ali,
and names with the prefix Abd- or Abdul, which means servant of, and is

followed by one of 99 suffixes used to describe God.

•  Many Arabic names begin with the word "Abu." If it is a first name, it is

probably not the person’s given name, because "Abu" means "father of."

Abu followed by a noun means “freedom” or “struggle,” and it is used by

both terrorists and legitimate political leaders. Only when Abu is a prefix of

a surname should it be accepted as a given name.

Version 6.44

Politically Exposed Persons Screening

Although financial organizations take measures to develop robust procedures

and screening processes to comply with sanctions and other customer
screening requirements, these controls sometimes fail to detect suspicious

high-risk individuals and businesses that organizations should avoid. For

example, intergovernmental bodies, such as FATF in its 40 Recommendations,
explicitly reference PEPs, and government regulations, specifically the EU’s

Fourth Directive, explicitly detail requirements related to PEPs. However, there
is no simple way to identify PEPs and their associates.

The problem is the lack of available and useful information about the identity

of PEPs around the world. There are many private providers that offer PEP

databases; however, the information contained in them and the ability to

positively match customers with PEPs on a database can be challenging. In

addition, as increased scrutiny continues to be placed on PEPs, they have

become more creative in finding ways to avoid detection, such as opening

accounts in the names of corporations (e.g., shell companies) in offshore

jurisdictions instead of in their own names or the names of close family

members. On the other hand, considering geographical issues, the size and

nature of an account, and the purpose of an account might raise PEP-related
issues.

There are some publicly available sources of information that can be used to

help identify PEPs and their associates. Transparency International, a global,

nongovernmental organization devoted to combating corruption, publishes

the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is useful in focusing on high-risk

jurisdictions. Some government agencies, such as the US Central Intelligence

Agency, publish lists of heads of state and cabinet members of foreign

governments. However, these lists do not provide all relevant information

related to PEPs that would assist in identifying them. For example, they do not

include unique identifiers, such as date of birth or address, which poses

significant operational constraints, particularly at large retail financial
organizations.

Accepting corruption proceeds from PEPs constitutes money laundering in

the United States. Under some countries’ laws, it may be a violation of its

sanctions rules. Because it is difficult to identify these parties, it is important to

have strong CDD and monitoring controls. It is also important to continually

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 306

Version 6.44

review and update customer screening and sanctions programs. This includes

updating procedures, tuning, and testing screening tools and training staff.

Know Your Employee

Financial organizations and businesses have learned at great expense that an

insider can pose the same money laundering threat as a customer. It has

become clear in the AML/CFT field that equivalent programs to know your
customer and know your employee (including contractors and third-party

vendors who support AML controls) are essential.

A Know Your Employee (KYE) program ensures that an organization has the

means to understand an employee’s background, conflicts of interest, and

susceptibility to money laundering complicity. Policies, procedures, internal

controls, job descriptions, levels of authority, compliance with personnel laws

and regulations, accountability, monitoring, dual control, and other deterrents

should be firmly in place. Additionally, codes of conduct and ethics should

specify mandatory requirements to report suspicious activity to the MLRO and

that failure to comply subjects an employee to disciplinary action and possible
employment termination.

Background screening of prospective and current employees and vendors,

especially for criminal history and ties to negative media, is essential to

prevent unwanted relationships and identify employees that should be

terminated. The US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides

guidance on employee screening in its paper, Pre-Employment Background
Screening: Guidance on Developing an Effective Pre-Employment

Background Screening Process.

Background screening can be an effective risk-management tool that

provides management with some assurance that the information provided by

the applicant is true and that the potential employee has no criminal record.

Used effectively, pre-employment background checks can reduce turnover

by verifying that the potential employee has the requisite skills, certification,

license, or degree for the position; deter theft and embezzlement; and

prevent litigation over hiring practices. An organization should also verify that

contractors and vendors are subject to screening procedures similar to its
own and include anti-corruption compliance clauses in agreements.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 307

Version 6.44

Developing and implementing an effective screening process can be costly.

However, without such a process, an organization might incur significant
expenses in recruiting, hiring, training, and ultimately terminating unqualified

individuals.

Sometimes, regulations prohibit a person who has been convicted of a crime

involving dishonesty or money laundering from becoming or continuing as an

institution-affiliated party; owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, an
institution; or otherwise participating, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of

the affairs of an institution without the prior written consent of the regulator.

Consultants who take part in the affairs of a financial organization could be
subject to this requirement, too.

Therefore, pre-employment background screening should be established by

all financial organizations, which, at a minimum, reveals information regarding

a job applicant’s criminal convictions. Sometimes, the level of screening

should be increased. The sensitivity of the position and the access level of an

individual employee might warrant additional background screening, which

should include verification of references, experience, education and

professional qualifications, according to the FDIC. The Monetary Authority of

Singapore’s guidelines on employee hiring also include screening against

ML/TF information sources, bankruptcy searches, and credit history checks.

Just as management verifies the identity of customers, it should also verify the

identity of job applicants. Once the person is hired, an ongoing approach to

screening should be considered for specific positions, as circumstances

change or as needed for a comprehensive review of departmental staff over

a period of time. Management should also establish policies that address what

to do when screening uncovers information contrary to what the applicant or
employee provided.

An organization can perform fingerprint checks periodically for employees in

sensitive positions, and contract with a vendor to conduct extensive

background checks when employees are being considered for promotion to

high-level positions. Without such screening procedures in place, financial

organizations risk violating the prohibition against employing statutorily

disqualified individuals. The extent of the screening depends on the

circumstances, with reasonableness being the standard.

In the UK, the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI)

publishes informative guidelines regarding insider threat and risk

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 308

Version 6.44

management. It includes examples of how insider threats and data leakages

can have devastating effects on an organization. Within financial
organizations, this could include abuse of pre-market information only known

by insiders. Many banks these days train their staff how to treat data in a
transparent, customer-centric, and law-abiding manner.

Regularly repeated training of employees regarding what is expected from

them should be part of typical on-the-job training. With social media being an
important day-to-day communication form for both private people and

organizations, KYE programs might also require organizations to monitor what

employees and other insiders mention and like on their social media accounts.
Social media accounts and posts on these accounts can provide ample

information regarding how a person might behave in an organization.

KYE (Case example: Citigroup Global
Markets Inc.)

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulates brokerage firms

doing business with the public in the US. In July 2019, it fined Citigroup Global

Markets Inc. (CGMI) US$1.25 million. FINRA found that CGMI failed to conduct

timely and adequate background checks on more than 10,000 employees

and may not have fingerprinted all required employees over a seven-year

period.

US federal securities laws require broker-dealers to perform background

screening and to fingerprint certain employees. These “know your employee”

requirements help determine if a person has a statutory disqualification that

would prevent them from being associated with a FINRA member firm

without explicit regulatory approval.

The failure to implement these supervisory controls and procedures prior to

employment meant that CGMI did not determine whether the individuals it

hired were subject to statutory disqualification. In fact, FINRA found that CGMI

employed or associated with three individuals who were subject to statutory

disqualification due to previous criminal convictions.

Background checks, or background screening, are an important part of an

organization’s know –your employee (KYE program). The purpose of a KYE

program is to ensure an institution does not compromise the financial system
Page 309

Version 6.44

by employing or associating with individuals with disqualifying criminal or

regulatory histories. Depending on the employer's risk appetite, screening is
typically completed before employment, with other regulatory requirements

completed before onboarding.

Regulators expect organizations to serve as responsible gatekeepers that

protect the financial system, themselves, their customers, and their investors

from criminals.

This case highlights the importance of regulatory expectations and

requirements for institutions concerning employment practices. Your

organizations need to know the requirements in your jurisdictions. Your
organization needs to develop and implement risk-based KYE frameworks to

ensure potential employees are properly screened and fingerprinted. These

practices protect the institution, customers, investors, and the financial

system.

Key takeaways

•  Know your regulatory requirements for KYE.

•  Effective KYE require background checks and fingerprinting.

•  Use a risk-based approach to the timing of background checks and other

pre-employment requirements.

•  KYE protects regulated companies, their customers and investors, and the

financial system.

Suspicious and Unusual Transaction
Monitoring and Reporting

Proper due diligence could require compliance personnel to gather further

information regarding a customer or transaction before deeming it suspicious

and filing an SAR. Although there are no hard and fast rules regarding what

constitutes suspicious activity, employees of financial organizations should

watch for activity that might be inconsistent with a customer’s source of
income or regular business activities.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 310

Version 6.44

Because financial organizations process thousands of transactions each day,

their systems for monitoring and reporting suspicious activity should be risk-
based and determined by factors such as the organization’s size, the nature of

its business, its location, the frequency and size of transactions, and the types
and geographical locations of its customers.

Generally, the core operating system of a financial organization maintains

significant customer data and can be utilized to generate specific internal
reports that are useful for discovering possible money laundering and terrorist

financing.

Examples of these reports include:

•  Daily cash activity exceeding the country’s reporting threshold

•  Daily cash activity just below the country’s reporting threshold (to identify

possible structuring)

•  Cash activity aggregated over a period of time (e.g., individual transactions
over a certain amount or totaling more than a certain amount over a 30-

day period, to identify possible structuring);

•  Wire transfer reports/logs with filters using amounts and geographical

factors

•  Monetary instrument logs/reports

•  Check kiting/drawing on uncollected funds with significant debit/credit

flows

•  Significant change reports

•  New account activity reports

Although reporting procedures vary from country to country, a typical

suspicious or unusual transaction reporting process within a financial

organization as part of its AML/CFT program includes:

•  Procedures to identify suspicious and unusual transactions and activity

through various channels, including employee observations and

identification, inquiries from law enforcement, and alerts generated by

transaction monitoring systems

•  Formal evaluation of each instance and continuation of unusual

transactions and activity

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 311

Version 6.44

•  Documentation of the SAR reporting decision (i.e., whether or not a report

was filed with authorities)

•  Procedures to periodically notify senior management or the board of

directors of SAR filings

•  Employee training on detecting suspicious transactions and activity

Most countries that require SAR reporting prohibit disclosing the filing to the

subject of the report (i.e., tipping off). In the United States, a financial
organization and its directors, officers, employees, and agents may not notify

any person involved in the transaction that it has been reported. Most laws

also grant immunity from civil liability (i.e., safe harbor) to the filing organization
and its employees.

The US has even made it illegal to reveal information that would lead to

knowledge of the existence of a SAR. This includes not only a prohibition on

divulging the SAR itself, but also the fact that a SAR was or was not filed. For

example, if an employee of a financial organization were asked whether it had

filed a SAR, a failure to answer could indirectly indicate that a SAR had been

filed. The confidentiality of SARs is a critical aspect of the whole reporting

program, because it protects financial organizations from being intimidated

from filing reports. After all, the reports are meant to provide useful

information to law enforcement, and the threat of lawsuits by criminals should
not deter financial organizations from fulfilling this important duty.

Strong recordkeeping procedures are key to managing any regulatory and

legal implications of SAR filing. National laws and regulations usually dictate the

length of time financial organizations and businesses must maintain records,

the types of records that must be stored, and how they should be provided to

regulatory and law enforcement personnel upon request.

There is no international clearinghouse for keeping SARs, but FIUs in various

countries often publish reports on how many SARs are filed each year, which

areas are filing the most reports, and what the suspicious activity and typology

trends are, as well as case studies. This information provides added guidance

to financial organizations operating within their jurisdiction regarding their
AML/CFT obligations.

Automated AML/CFT Solutions

The sheer number of people and the volume of regulations and data involved

in complying with regulations make manual AML/CFT compliance difficult, if
not impossible. Most organizations have designated technology systems to

automate their compliance activities, and some still undertake their efforts

manually.

Appropriately functioning technology can equip financial organizations with

improved defenses in the fight against financial crime by providing the
following:

•  Automated customer verification: Using third-party databases to compare

information provided by a customer with source data

•  Watch list filtering: Screening new accounts, existing customers,

beneficiaries, and transaction counterparties against terrorist, criminal, and

other blocked-persons sanctions and/or watch lists

•  Transaction monitoring: Scanning and analyzing transactional data for

potential money laundering activity

•  Automation of regulatory reporting: Filing SARs, CTRs, and other regulatory

reports with the government

•  Case management: Providing a dashboard feature to view customer KYC,

transaction history, investigations undertaken, and regulatory filings filed on

a customer

•  Audit trail: Documenting steps taken to demonstrate compliance efforts to

auditors and supervisory authorities

Automation is used for more than increased efficiency and control. It also can

reflect a company’s commitment to meet or exceed compliance

requirements. A byproduct of this commitment is that regulators can receive

prompt, concise, and properly formatted information.

Many software companies offer technology dedicated to combat laundering,

and some organizations have internally generated electronic systems. Before

designing an AML/CFT compliance program or purchasing new technology,

financial organizations should review the feasibility, costs, and benefits to be

derived from each course of action.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 313

Version 6.44

Some financial organizations choose to hire a vendor to provide AML/CFT

software packages. Many organizations use a Request for Proposal (RFP)
method in which they issue RFPs to software providers that might be qualified

to participate. An RFP lists project specifications and application procedures.
The objective of the RFP is to select a system that will assist the organization in

completing its responsibilities under applicable money laundering regulations.

The system(s) can help identify potentially high-risk customers, accounts, and
transactions; aid in conducting, managing, and documenting any resulting

investigations; and streamline the completion and filing of required SARs.

Most organizations seek a partner with a longstanding commitment to stay
ahead of the rapidly changing regulatory landscape and experience that

reflects flexibility, agility, and urgency in delivering features that improve its
clients’ efficiency in monitoring the right transactions and investigating the

right clients. Ideally, the system is flexible, fast, and efficient to deploy. It should

allow the organization to navigate seamlessly around client relationships,

accounts, and transactions across a variety of product lines and systems,

including deposits, wires, transfers, loans, trust, brokerage, letters of credit,

and check-imaging applications. A single view into customer relationships is of

paramount importance in delivering efficient, reliable, and instant access to

information. Each organization needs to identify the vendor that best meets

its needs. During the RFP process, most organizations form evaluation teams

comprising management staff from the compliance, operations, technology,

and business departments. The team, facilitated by the project manager, is
responsible for reviewing and scoring all responses to the RFP.

Determining the most applicable system for a financial organization depends

on its customer base, size, and products and services offered. In general, it

should consider the following capabilities of the system during its assessment

process:

•  Ability to monitor transactions and identify anomalies that might indicate

suspicious activity

•  Ability to gather CDD information for new and existing customers, score

customer responses, and store CDD data for subsequent use

•  Ability to conduct advanced evaluation and analysis of suspicious and

unusual transactions identified by the monitoring system in the context of

each customer’s risk profile and that of his peer group

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 314

Version 6.44

•  Ability to view individual alerts within the broader context of the customer’s

total activity at the organization

•  Workflow features, including the ability to create a case from an alert or
series of alerts, collaborate (simultaneously or serially) among multiple
interested parties to view and update information, and share AML/CFT-

related information across monitoring and investigating units and

throughout the organization, as needed

•  Ability to use data from the organization’s core customer and transaction

systems and databases to inform and update monitoring and case-

management activities

•  Ability to store and recall at least 12 months of data for trend analysis

•  Ability to manage the assignment, routing, approval, and ongoing

monitoring of suspicious activity investigations

•  Automated preparation and filing of SARs to FIUs

•  Standard and ad-hoc reporting on the nature and volume of suspicious

activity investigations and investigator productivity for management and

other audiences

•  Enhanced ability to plan, assign, and monitor the caseload per employee of

AML-related investigations

•  Ability to provide comprehensive and accurate reporting of all aspects of

AML compliance, including reporting to management, reporting to

regulators, productivity reporting, and ad-hoc reporting

•  User-friendly updating of risk-parameter settings without the need for

special technical computing skills

•  Tiered user-rights access for users, managers, and auditors

In addition to the above features, financial organizations should evaluate the

following aspects of automated systems:

•  Ease of use of the application, as well as the configuration of new and

changed transaction monitoring rules

•  Ease of data integration, system implementation, and configuration

•  Scalability of application, i.e., the ability of the system to grow with the

organization

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 315

Version 6.44

•  Extent to which the system can be supported with internal resources

•  User satisfaction with hardware and software support

•  Price, including initial cost and ongoing costs to sustain the system or

expand its capabilities, both in terms of what the vendor will charge and
how much the organization will need to spend in terms of dollars,

personnel, and technology capacity

In addition to providing possible regulatory compliance solutions, automated
tools can help an organization analyze how customers and other users are

using its products and services. For marketing purposes, patterns of activity

among types of customers and different business lines can be represented by
graphs and statistical reports. Depending on an organization’s needs, a variety

of software products can automate these tasks—from standard analytical
systems to sophisticated artificial intelligence.

Automated tools can also help with documentation management, which can

be a significant burden for many financial organizations. Historically, imaging

systems offered quick and paperless access to records. However,

convenience is not enough. New systems can track and report the status of all

documents, including those that are missing and expired. One-stop access

systems can provide images, standardization, and control for documents that

must be accounted for and produced for compliance purposes.

Money Laundering and Terrorist

Financing Red Flags

Although there is no exhaustive list of tried-and-true suspicious activity

indicators for businesses, there are many common indicators of financial

crime, money laundering, and terrorist-financing activity that organizations
can watch for.

Methods of money laundering have become more sophisticated as the

complexity of financial relationships has grown and the paths through which

funds move worldwide through financial organizations have multiplied.

Worldwide terrorist threats are also a concern. Financial organizations and

NBFIs play a critical part in efforts to disrupt the movement of funds used to

support and carry out terrorist attacks. Although it may be difficult to detect

terrorist financing transactions, there is guidance available from a variety of

authoritative sources. Red flag indicator guidance should be used when

building out and refining transaction monitoring programs.

The following situations might warrant additional scrutiny, as they can indicate

money laundering or terrorist financing. These lists are not exhaustive, but

they will help to determine whether an activity is suspicious or does not

appear to have a reasonable business or legal purpose.

for loan-modification programs intended for homeowners in financial

distress.

•  There is a request from third-party affiliates on behalf of distressed
homeowners to pay fees in advance of the homeowner receiving

mortgage counseling, foreclosure avoidance, loan modification, or other

related service.

•  A third party solicits distressed homeowners for purported mortgage
counseling, foreclosure avoidance, loan modification, or other related

services. These third parties might also claim to be associated with

legitimate mortgage lenders, the US government, or a US government

program.

Activity for Dealers of Precious Metals and
Other High-Value Items

The FATF Report, Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Through Trade in

Diamonds, describes transactional and other red flag indicators related to

trade practices, including:

•  Diamonds originate from a country where there is limited production or no

diamond mines at all.

•  Trade is conducted in large volumes with countries that are not part of the

diamond pipeline.

•  The volume of purchases and/or imports grossly exceeds the expected

sales amount.

•  Gold bars, coins, and loose diamonds are sold from a jewelry store (i.e.,

retail).

•  There is an increase in the volume of activity in a diamond dealer’s account,

despite a significant decrease in the industry-wide volume.

•  An intermediary located abroad facilitates the selling and buying of

diamonds between two local companies (lack of business justification

and/or uncertainty as to actual passage of goods between companies).

•  Payments related to the appearance of rare or unique diamonds are made

in the international market outside of known trading procedures (e.g.,

Argyle’s rare pink diamond appearing in the international marketplace

outside of the annual tender process).

•  A single bank account is used by multiple businesses.

•  A single bank account has multiple deposit handlers (retail and wholesale).

•  Third parties are used to deposit funds into a single dealer’s or multiple

diamond dealers’ accounts.

•  Financial activity is inconsistent with practices in the diamond trade.

•  Deposits or transfers to a diamond dealer’s account from foreign

companies are followed by the immediate transfer of similar amounts to

another jurisdiction.

Page 331

Version 6.44

•  Open export is settled by offsetting to, and receiving payment from, a third

party.

•  Funds are received/transferred for import/export, and the ordering

customer/beneficiary is an MSB.

•  The name of receiver in the payment from the diamond dealer is not the

exporter/supplier.

Unusual Activity Indicative of Trade-Based
Money Laundering

•  Payment is made by virtually any method (e.g., cash, wire, check, or bank
drafts) by a third party with no connection to the underlying transaction.

•  Structured currency deposits are made to individual checking accounts
with multiple daily deposits to multiple accounts at different branches of

the same bank on the same day.

•  There are discrepancies between the description of goods or commodity

in the invoice and the actual goods shipped.

•  Letters of credit are amended without justification.

•  There is no apparent business relationship between the parties and

transactions.

•  Frequent transactions are conducted in round or whole dollars.

•  Funds are transferred into an account and moved to a high-risk country in

the same amount.

•  Companies operate in jurisdictions where their business purpose is not fully

understood, and there are difficulties in determining ownership.

•  There is a lack of appropriate documentation to support transactions.

•  Negotiable instruments are used to fund transactions in sequential

numbers and/or have missing payee information.

Unusual Activity Indicative of Human
Smuggling

According to FinCEN, the following are red flags for human smuggling:

•  Multiple wire transfers, generally kept below the US$3,000 reporting

threshold, are sent from various locations across the United States to a
common beneficiary located in a US or Mexican city along the southwest

border.

•  Multiple wire transfers are conducted at different branches of a financial

organization to or from US or Mexican cities along the southwest border on

the same day or on consecutive days.

•  Money flows do not fit common remittance patterns:

o  Wire transfers that originate from countries with high migrant

populations (e.g., Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras) are

directed to beneficiaries located in a US or Mexican city along the

southwest border.

o  Beneficiaries receive wire transfers from countries with high migrant
populations (e.g., Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras), but

they are not nationals of those countries.

•  Unusual currency deposits into US financial organizations are followed by
wire transfers to countries with high migrant populations (e.g., Mexico,

Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras) in a manner that is inconsistent with

expected customer activity. This might include sudden increases in cash

deposits, rapid turnover of funds, and large volumes of cash deposits with

unknown sources of funds.

•  Multiple apparently unrelated customers send wire transfers to the same

beneficiary, who might be located in a US or Mexican city along the

southwest border. These customers might also use similar transactional

information, including, but not limited to, common amounts, addresses,

and phone numbers. When questioned to the extent circumstances allow,

the customers might have no apparent relation to the recipient of the

funds or know the purpose of the wire transfers.

•  A customer’s account appears to function as a funnel account, whereby

cash deposits (often kept below the US$10,000 reporting threshold) occur
Page 333

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

in cities/states where the customer does not reside or conduct business.

Frequently, in the case of funnel accounts, the funds are quickly withdrawn
(same day) after the deposits are made.

•  Checks deposited from a possible funnel account appear to be pre-

signed, bearing different handwriting in the signature and payee fields.

•  A customer who is not in a cash-intensive industry frequently exchanges

small denomination for larger denomination bills. This type of activity might
occur when smugglers prepare proceeds for bulk cash shipments.

•  When customer accounts near the southwest border are closed due to
suspicious activity, new customers might begin transacting on behalf of
the customers whose accounts have been closed, as a means to continue

illicit activities. In this case, new accounts often reflect activity similar to that

of the closed accounts; transactions might be frequently occurring,

currency-intensive, and involve individuals who used to receive/send funds

from/to accounts previously closed due to suspicious activity.

•  Customer exhibits an unexplained/unjustified lifestyle that is not

commensurate with his employment or business line, or profits/deposits

are significantly greater than that of peers in similar professions/business

lines.

•

Inflows are largely received in cash, and substantial cash receipts are

inconsistent with the customer’s line of business; there is an extensive use

of cash to purchase assets and conduct transactions.

Unusual Activity Indicative of Human
Trafficking

According to FinCEN’s Guidance on Recognizing Activity that May be

Associated with Human Smuggling and Human Trafficking—Financial Red
Flags, the following are red flags for human trafficking:

•  A business customer does not exhibit normal payroll expenditures (e.g.,

wages, payroll taxes, and social security contributions); payroll costs might

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 334

Version 6.44

be nonexistent or extremely low for the size of the customer’s alleged

operations, workforce, and/or business line/model.

•  Wages are substantially deducted. To the extent a financial organization is
able to observe, a customer with a business might deduct large amounts
from the wages of its employees, alleging extensive charges (e.g., housing

and food costs), and the employees only receive a small fraction of their

wages. These deductions might occur before or after the payment of
wages.

•  Payroll checks are cashed, but the majority of the funds are kept by the
employer or deposited back into the employer’s account. This activity
might be detected by financial organizations that have access to paystubs

and other payroll records.

•  Frequent outbound wire transfers, with no business or apparent lawful

purpose, are directed to countries at high risk for human trafficking or to

countries that are inconsistent with the customer’s expected activity.

•  A customer’s account appears to function as a funnel account, whereby

cash deposits occur in cities/states where the customer does not reside or

conduct business. Frequently, in the case of funnel accounts, the funds are

quickly withdrawn (same day) after the deposits are made.

•  Multiple apparently unrelated customers send wire transfers to the same

beneficiary. These customers might also use similar transactional

information, including, but not limited to, a common address and phone

number. When questioned to the extent circumstances allow, the

customers might have no apparent relation to the recipient of the funds or

know the purpose of the wire transfers.

•  Transactions are conducted by individuals and escorted by a third party

(e.g., under the pretext of requiring an interpreter) to transfer funds, which

seem to be their salaries, to other countries.

•  Frequent payments are made to online escort services for advertising,

including small posting fees to companies of online classifieds and more

costly, high-end advertising and website hosting companies.

•  Frequent transactions, inconsistent with expected activity and/or line of
business, are carried out by a business customer in an apparent effort to

provide sustenance to individuals, such as payment for housing, lodging,
regular vehicle rentals, and purchases of large amounts of food.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 335

Version 6.44

•  Payments are made to employment or student recruitment agencies that

are not licensed/registered or that have labor violations.

•  A customer establishes an account or visits a branch to conduct

transactions while escorted by a third party (e.g., under the pretext of
requiring an interpreter). The third party escorting the customer might

have possession of the customer’s ID.

•  A common signer/custodian is used in apparently unrelated business

and/or personal accounts. Similarly, common information (e.g., address,

phone number, and employment information) is used to open multiple

accounts in different names.

•  An employer or employment agency serves as a custodian for the

accounts of foreign workers or students.

•  Customer exhibits an unexplained/unjustified lifestyle that is not

commensurate with his employment or business line, or profits/deposits

are significantly greater than that of peers in similar professions/business

lines.

•

Inflows are largely received in cash, and substantial cash receipts are

inconsistent with the customer’s line of business; there is an extensive use

of cash to purchase assets and conduct transactions.

The following two red flags might signal anomalous customer activity;

however, they should be applied in tandem with other indicators when

determining whether transactions are linked to human trafficking:

•  Transactional activity (e.g., credits and/or debits) is inconsistent with a
customer’s alleged employment, business, or expected activity, or

transactions lack a business or apparent lawful purpose.

•  Cash deposits or wire transfers are kept below US$3,000 or US$10,000 in
an apparent effort to avoid recordkeeping and CTR filing requirements,

respectively.

Unusual Activity Indicative of Potential
Terrorist Financing

The Egmont Group reviewed 22 terrorist financing cases submitted by FIUs

and identified the following financial and behavioral indicators that were most

frequently associated with terrorist financing:

Behavior indicators

•  Parties to the transaction (e.g., owner, beneficiary) from countries known

to support terrorist activities and organizations

•  Use of false corporations, including shell companies

•

Inclusion of the individual on the United Nations 1267 Sanctions list

•  Media reports that the account holder is linked to a known terrorist

organization or engaged in terrorist activities

•  Beneficial owner of the account is not properly identified

•  Use of nominees, trusts, family member, or third-party accounts

•  Use of false identification

•  Abuse of nonprofit organizations

Indicators linked to financial transactions

•  Use of funds by nonprofit organization inconsistent with the purpose for

which it was established

•  Transaction not economically justified, considering the account holder’s

business or profession

•  Series of complicated transfers of funds from one person to another as a

means to hide their source and intended use

•  Transactions that are inconsistent with the account’s typical activity

•  Deposits structured below the reporting requirements to avoid detection

•  Multiple cash deposits and withdrawals with suspicious references

•  Frequent domestic and international ATM activity

•  No business rationale or economic justifications for the transactions

•  Unusual cash activity in foreign bank accounts

•  Multiple cash deposits in small amounts in an account, followed by a large

wire transfer to another country

•  Use of multiple foreign bank accounts

Unusual Activity Indicative of Cyber
Criminal Activity

Cybercrimes are crimes committed using the internet or other computer

technology to target individuals. The incidence of cybercrime is growing, and

it is becoming one of the most prevalent financial crimes around the world.

Cybercriminals are motivated by financial or ideological goals. Some of the

most common cybercrimes include:

•  Phishing Scams: Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails or
texts purporting to be from a reputable company to try to obtain an

individual’s login credentials or personal identifiable information. This

practice is done on an individual basis and in mass (bulk phishing).

•  Spear Phishing: Similar to phishing, spear phishing messages appear to
come from a trusted source that is familiar to the victim. Typically spear

phishing uses information about the victim that was collected using social

media.

•  Ransomware: This is an attack conducted by a hacker in which malicious
software designed to block access to a computer system is installed and

not removed until a sum of money is paid.

•  Business Email Compromise (BEC): BEC is a scam in which an attacker

obtains access to a business email account and imitates an executive’s

identity in order to defraud the company.

FinCEN has an advisory on red flags that describes cybercrimes and the types

of reviews that should be conducted when suspecting a cybercrime.

Conducting and

Responding to

Investigations

This chapter discusses the various channels through which financial

organizations receive information with which to initiate investigations and

explains the steps they should take to ensure that investigations are

conducted thoroughly and effectively.

Investigations Initiated by the

Financial Organization

Sources of Investigations

Investigations can be initiated from proactive monitoring for potentially

suspicious activity and reactive measures taken to address regulatory
findings, referrals, and other recommendations.

Common investigation initiators include:

•  Regulatory recommendations and official findings

•  Transaction monitoring rules designed to detect and trigger alerts on

potentially suspicious activity

•  Referrals from customer-facing employees regarding potentially

suspicious activity

•

Information obtained from internal hotlines

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 339

Version 6.44

•  Negative media information

•  Receipt of a governmental subpoena, search warrant, or other law

enforcement request

Regulatory recommendations and official findings

Financial organizations often initiate investigative efforts based on regulatory

findings and recommendations. These efforts could result in the creation of
new ongoing monitoring or serve as one-time reviews to address specific

questions or observations. Most importantly, investigations that are initiated as

a result of regulatory findings should be clearly documented and designed to
ensure that all aspects of the findings are addressed within the time frame (if

any) provided by the issuing body. Moreover, senior management or higher-

level professionals should be informed of the findings of the regulatory review,

the status of measures to address them, and their final disposition to ensure

the financial organization appropriately remediates the findings or
recommendations.

Transaction monitoring

Financial organizations should establish a program to regularly monitor

transactions to proactively identify potentially suspicious activity. Common

approaches to transaction monitoring include the creation of in-house,

customizable transaction monitoring rules or engaging a third-party vendor to

assist with the development and implementation of automated rules. Financial

organizations should use a risk-based approach to designing transaction

monitoring rules that considers the size of the organization, products offered,

and features of those products.

The organization should also have policies and procedures for monitoring for

suspicious activity and clearly specify the parameters and thresholds that are

set to trigger an investigation. These policies should be regularly reviewed and

updated to account for changes and enhancements to the monitoring rules

program.

The Wolfsberg Group noted in its Statement on Monitoring, Screening, and

Searching that an organization’s transaction monitoring framework should be

aligned to the risk of its business model, the products and services offered,

and its customer base, and it should be embedded in the
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 340

Version 6.44

organization’s AML program. The document additionally discusses types of

monitoring, typology reviews, and staff training.

Transaction monitoring rules should be regularly reviewed and tuned

accordingly to ensure that they continue to operate as designed. Tuning
practices may include evaluating the output of monitoring rules, examining

specific thresholds and conducting above and below-the-line testing to

determine whether rule adjustments are necessary.

Referrals from customer-facing employees

In addition to automated, ongoing transaction monitoring, financial
organizations often have a mechanism by which customer-facing employees

can refer matters to be investigated for potentially suspicious activity.

Depending on the size of the organization, there could be manual referral

processes via email or telephone, or an internal reporting system that routes

the referrals to the appropriate investigative teams. For example, a financial

organization might have a specific, internal, online form that can be

completed by branch personnel when they identify unusual activity. Examples

of such activity include a customer who structures transactions, currency that

contains an odor indicative of controlled substances, and inconsistent

responses by the customer to questions regarding the source of large cash

deposits. Upon completion of the form by the branch, it is delivered to a

designated AML/CFT compliance email address. Subsequently, the AML/CFT

team reviews the activity during the normal course of its investigations

process. The existence of these referral mechanisms and the types of activity

that may warrant referrals should be included in employee training programs,

especially for those employees on the first line of defense.

Internal hotlines

Internal hotlines are also known as ethics, compliance, and whistleblower

hotlines. They allow employees to report a wide range of activity, including

employee fraud, harassment, discrimination, violations of codes of conduct,

theft of company property, and inappropriate gifts. The hotlines might ask the

employee to provide his identity, but most allow for anonymous reporting. In

either case, in most jurisdictions, the financial organization is prohibited from

retaliating against the person who made a report via the hotline. The financial

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 341

Version 6.44

organization must maintain policies, procedures, and processes to

confidentially investigate the information provided through the hotline. The
size and scale of a financial organization will determine the organizational

recipient of the hotline information, such as legal, compliance, human
resources, or corporate security.

Negative media information

Investigations can be initiated in response to notable media stories about a

financial organization’s customer, how a product is used in the market, a

geographic location it serves, or a money laundering or terrorist event. Thus,
financial organizations should develop a process to receive, review, and

escalate these types of potentially high-priority triggers. It is critical to

determine whether the negative information is financially risk-relevant to the

organization. In some instances, financial organizations might proactively

monitor media stories and initiate investigations to determine if a SAR should
be filed and if further actions are necessary.

Version 6.44

Receipt of a governmental subpoena or search warrant

Financial organizations often initiate investigations upon receipt of a

governmental subpoena or search warrant. In either situation, the

organization has two independent obligations: (1) legally fulfill the
requirements of the subpoena or warrant, and (2) determine whether the

activity of its customer identified in the subpoena or warrant requires the filing
of a SAR.

Notably, banking regulatory agencies do not need to use subpoenas, search

warrants, or other jurisdiction-specific legal mechanisms. Rather, their
authority to conduct examinations includes the ability to inspect all books and

records of a regulated organization.

Subpoena

Subpoenas are usually issued by grand juries that operate under the purview

of a court. They empower a law enforcement agency to compel the

production of documents and testimony, which allow the law enforcement

agency to investigate suspicious transactions, develop evidence, and,

ultimately, put together a case for prosecution.

When an organization is served with a subpoena compelling the production of

certain documents or summon an individual related to its customer, the

organization should ensure its senior management and/or legal counsel

reviews the subpoena and independently confirms its legitimacy (e.g., to

confirm that it is not an attempted fraud to obtain confidential information). If

there are no grounds for contesting the subpoena, the organization should

take all appropriate measures to comply with the summons or subpoena on a

timely and complete basis. Failure to do so can result in adverse action and

penalties for the financial organization. The financial organization should never

notify the customer being investigated.

To produce documents related to governmental requests, an organization

should start by appoint an employee with knowledge of the organization’s files

to take charge of retrieving documents for the organization. A system must

be in place to ensure that all documents are located, whether they be in

central files, department files, or individual files. In addition, copies of the same

document in different hands should be retrieved, because some copies might
have handwritten notes by the employees who received them.
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 343

Version 6.44

If the government asks the organization to keep certain accounts open, this

request should be obtained in writing under proper letterhead and authority
from the government. The request should include the duration for which the

account should remain open. Documentation of the request should be
maintained for at least five years after the request has expired.

Search warrant

A search warrant is a grant of permission from a court for a law enforcement

agency to search certain designated premises and seize specific categories

of items or documents. Generally, the requesting agency is required to
establish that probable cause exists that evidence of a crime will be located.

The warrant is authorized based on information contained in an affidavit

submitted by a law enforcement officer.

When a search warrant is served, it is important that everyone present remain

calm. Every employee should know that a search warrant is not usually an

open-ended demand. Instead, it gives the law enforcement agents the right

to enter the premises, search, and seize only certain items or documents. A

search warrant also does not compel testimony.

When presented with a search warrant, an organization should consider

taking the following steps:

•  Call the financial organization’s in-house or outside legal counsel and/or
designated officer in charge of security, risk management, or a similar

business area.

•  Review the warrant to understand its scope.

•  Ask for and obtain a copy of the warrant.

•  Ask for a copy of the affidavit that supports the search warrant. The agents

are not obligated to provide a copy of the affidavit; however, when a

financial organization is allowed to review the affidavit, it can learn more

about the purpose of the investigation.

•  Remain present while the agents make an inventory of all items they seize
and remove from the premises and keep track of the records taken by the

agents.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 344

Version 6.44

•  Ask for a copy of law enforcement’s inventory of what it has seized.

•  Document the names and agency affiliations of the agents who conduct

the search.

Documents and computer records that are protected by the attorney-client
and other legal privileges should be so marked and retained separately from

general records. Privileged records should be stored in an area (e.g., a

cabinet) labeled “Attorney-Client Privilege.”

If law enforcement agents want to seize privileged records, organization

representatives may object and suggest, as an alternative, that the records be

given to the court for safekeeping. All employees should be trained on how to
behave in a search, and one person should be designated to communicate

with the agents.

Orders to restrain or freeze accounts or assets

When a law enforcement agency or prosecutor obtains a court order to

freeze an account or prevent funds from being withdrawn or moved, the

organization should obtain a copy of the order and make every effort to

comply. Generally, such an order is obtained based on a sworn affidavit, which

is sometimes included with the order. If the affidavit is not part of the order,

the financial organization can ask to see the affidavit, which should provide

clues as to why a customer’s information is being requested. Whether law

enforcement authorities are obligated to provide the affidavit depends on

each country’s laws and regulations. In some jurisdictions, freezing orders can
also be executed by seizure warrant.

National security letters

National Security Letters (NSLs) are authorized by four federal statutes: the

USA PATRIOT Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, National Security

Act, and Fair Credit and Reporting Act. However, several amendments were

added to the USA PATRIOT Act and the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization of

2006. These amendments significantly reduced the standards required to

issue an NSL and expanded the utilization NSLs by the FBI and other federal
agencies in limited circumstances, when counterintelligence and

counterterrorism investigations are being conducted.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 345

Version 6.44

The most common type of NSLs can be issued directly by the FBI leadership

including the director, assistant director and special agents in charge. An NSL
is a written investigative demand requiring third-party businesses, such as

credit reporting agencies, telecommunications/internet service providers,
and financial institutions, to provide a broad range of data and information on

investigation targets, including telephone and electronic communications

records, credit report information, and financial records

The NSL process is secret and does not require a judge’s approval or other

judicial oversight. Third-party businesses are not permitted to disclose the

receipt of an NSL (i.e., gag order). Pursuant to 12 USC 3414(a)(3) and (5)(D), no
bank, officer, employee, or agent of the institution can disclose to any person

that a government authority or the FBI has sought or obtained access to
records through a Right to Financial Privacy Act NSL.

Keeping records

Proper recordkeeping is a requirement, and it can help protect a financial

organization from regulatory findings. Records that must be kept include CDD

information and EDD records. You must also keep information about

suspicious activity reports made to the authorities and internally reported

suspicious activity that did not require a report to the authorities. Finally, keep

records that describe your internal AML controls and your training records for
all relevant staff.

Sources of investigations (Case example:
Preserving subpoenaed audio recordings)

In September 2020, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)

announced that it settled charges against Citibank and its affiliates, Citigroup

Energy Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets. Citibank failed to preserve audio

recordings that were subject to a hold notice in connection with a subpoena

sent by the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement in December 2017. Citibank

admitted that more than 2.77 million audio recordings were deleted due to a

flaw in its system, including files responsive to the subpoena that should have

been preserved. The Citibank entities agreed to pay a US$4.5 million fine.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 346

Version 6.44

CFTC determined that, from at least 2014 through at least November 2018,

Citibank entities violated CFTC regulation 166.3: Failure to
supervise.  According to the regulation, records subject to subpoena should

be segregated and stored safely. Senior management should ensure that
adequate systems and staff are in place to meet legal and regulatory

requirements. Any recordkeeping and regulatory deficiencies should be

escalated to senior management and addressed in a timely manner. In
addition, remedial action plans should be required, implemented, and tracked

for system deficiencies.

In 2014, Citibank determined that the system used to preserve audio
recordings was not reliable for addressing legal holds to meet recordkeeping

requirements and regulatory requests. Citibank implemented a stopgap
measure to preserve audio recordings indefinitely. The audio recordings

would be preserved as long as there was sufficient storage space. The system

reached the storage threshold in October 2018 and automatically began

deleting older recordings, including recordings subject to a December 2017

subpoena. The subpoena department should have sent legal hold notices to

the applicable parties and segregated and preserved the responsive records.

This did not occur. Further, despite being notified of the problem, Citibank did

not take timely and adequate steps to mitigate the associated risks.

Citibank’s failures, which led to deleting audio recordings subpoenaed by the

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff, included:

•  Failed to adequately staff the department responsible for the oversight of

audio recording preservation

•  Failed to adequately train staff to understand and recognize the risks of

deleting audio files based on first-in, first-out settings

•  Failed to fully document system changes and ensure adequate

procedures were in place for the system

•  Failed to preserve audio recordings through system backups

•  Failed to escalate the system weaknesses to Citibank management, the

legal department, or any other compliance department

Key takeaways

•  Records subject to subpoena should be segregated and stored safely.

•  Senior management should ensure adequate systems and sufficient staff

are in place to meet legal and regulatory requirements

•  Recordkeeping and regulatory deficiencies should be escalated to senior

management and addressed in a timely manner

•  Remedial action plans should be required, implemented, and tracked for

system deficiencies

Sources of investigations (Case example:
Acting on seizure warrants)

Regulators assessed a civil money penalty against a midsize regional bank for

failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. The

regulators determined that Midsize failed to detect suspicious activity related

to legal orders and failed to file timely suspicious activity reports (SARs). Over

US$100 million in criminal proceeds from a trade-based money laundering
scheme was processed through the institution over a four-year period.

Additionally, despite receiving a seizure warrant from law enforcement, the

bank failed to freeze US$1.25 million in funds from the suspect account. The

bank was ordered to pay a US$10 million civil money penalty and agreed to a

US$1.25 million forfeiture.

The bank required its legal department to process all legal orders, including

subpoenas, keep-open letters, and seizure warrants. However, the legal

department did not establish a formal process or document written policies
for reporting legal orders related to bank customers to the AML department.

The AML department also did not adopt policies requiring the review of

subpoenas, keep-open letters, and seizure warrants to determine if the

underlying account activity was suspicious. Accordingly, it failed to review

hundreds of accounts that were subject to legal orders for suspicious

activities. It also failed to file timely SARs. In one case, the AML department

failed to review an account subject to multiple subpoenas which resulted in

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 348

Version 6.44

over US$100 million in suspicious transactions. The AML department was

unaware the account records had been subpoenaed.

Law enforcement served a seizure warrant for US$1.5 million in funds

remaining in the account. However, the bank allowed an additional US$5
million in funds transfers to be processed through the account. Eventually, the

remaining balance was US$250,000. The legal department failed to freeze the

funds due to backlogs, and the AML department had not been informed of
the seizure warrant.

Ultimately, the bank agreed to forfeit US$1.25 million related to the funds

released. The regulators ordered the bank to pay a US$10 million civil money
penalty.

Key takeaways

•  Financial organizations must implement policies and procedures to

appropriately respond to legal orders, including timely processing of

seizure warrants.

•  Effective communication among departments within financial

organizations is critical to ensure that suspicious activities are reported to

the AML department.

•  The timely filing of SARs is an important element of effective AML

programs.

Conducting the Investigation

Several key actions are required to conduct an effective financial investigation

into potential suspicious activity, including:

•  Reviewing internal transactions, including value and volume, information
obtained from the customer, and other relevant internal documentation

•  Determining whether the activity is expected for the customer

•

Identifying and reviewing external information to understand the

customer, related entities, and relevant media

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 349

Version 6.44

•  Contacting business line employees who are responsible for the account

relationship

•  Generating a written report that documents relevant findings

A financial investigator’s main objective is to track the movement of money,
whether through a bank, broker-dealer, money services business, casino, or

other financial organization. Financial organizations have access to a wealth of

information, because they are in the business of taking in, paying out,
accounting for, and recording the movement of money. For example, banks

maintain signature cards, which are collected at the opening of an account,

account statements, deposit tickets, checks and withdrawal items, and credit
and debit memorandums. Financial organizations also keep records on loans,

cashier’s checks, certified checks, traveler’s checks, and money orders. They

exchange currency, cash third-party checks, and conduct wire transfers, as

do most MSBs. Financial organizations also keep safe deposit boxes and issue

credit cards. Online-based financial organizations maintain login activity logs,
IP addresses, and geographical location information.

Often, financial organizations are required to keep records of customer

accounts for five years, such as in the EU, US, and Canada. Although that rule

might vary in different countries, it is important for compliance officers at

financial organizations to be aware of these legal requirements. Account

records and records of other nonaccount activities can be essential to

tracking possible money laundering. Other financial organizations keep similar

records of transactions and the ability to exert control over an account, such
as the ability to trade stocks in a brokerage account.

With all the information financial organizations are privy to, it is important for

them to develop and maintain policies and procedures regarding financial

investigations. Typically, financial organizations identify the procedural steps

required, the information needed to complete the investigation, and any
recommended next steps.

Following are two examples of the steps in a financial investigation:

1.  An investigation is initiated after a branch teller identifies a new customer

who conducted large cash deposits at three different branches on

consecutive days just below the statutory cash-reporting threshold.

Subsequently, the customer wired 95 percent of the funds to an unrelated
individual located in a high-risk jurisdiction that is known as a gateway for

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 350

Version 6.44

narcotics traffickers. According to the financial organization’s investigation

policies and procedures, the following must be done: Conduct a
documented review of the customers’ accounts for one year, including all

transactions, KYC information, and social media searches for any relevant
negative media. The report must analyze the information reviewed,

determine whether or not a SAR should be filed, and take any additional

remedial measures.

2.  An investigation results from a transaction monitoring alert that identified

large, round-dollar wire transfers to a commercial customer from

import/export companies with generic names located in high-risk
jurisdictions. The KYC review indicated the customer was engaged in

furniture sales through several retail locations. Further, it identified a high
volume of incoming check and credit transactions and no incoming wire

transfers; however, the customer originated wire transfers to low-risk

jurisdictions to purchase the furniture. This investigation led to contacting

the relationship manager for information about the customer’s activity to

assist with explaining the deviation. If unexplained, the next step in the

investigation would be to determine whether such activity warranted a

SAR filing.

Utilizing the internet when conducting financial investigations

An effective investigation requires that information be sourced both from the

information held by the financial organizations and from external sources.

Care should be taken to ensure that the information found is reliable and

verifiable, and the assistance of external specialists is sought if necessary. It is

critical to be confident about the soundness of the information relied upon

during an investigation, especially when it could be the deciding factor in

closing an account or terminating a business relationship.

The internet is often used to source information as part of internal

investigations. A focused approach to searching reliable and reputable

sources can provide useful third-party information and additional context to

the files held by financial organizations. Combined with a review of internal

documents and records, internet sources can help provide a complete

understanding of whether further steps are needed to mitigate possible
financial crime risks associated with the customer.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 351

Version 6.44

Conducting research on the internet is most effective when there is a clear

understanding of what online sources are considered reliable. For example,
social media sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn can be useful to verify some

information, but blogs and comments posted on these sites might not prove
to be reliable sources about an individual’s reputation. Independent websites

maintained by independent standards bodies (e.g., FATF, Wolfsberg, and

OECD) and supervisory authorities (e.g., national and state-level regulators,
corporate registrars, electoral rolls, and registration lists) can provide valuable

information concerning regulatory status, sanctions, fines, business activities,

and broader commercial activities of the party under investigation.
Furthermore, these sources are considered to have a high degree of

reliability.

In some countries, court lists, decisions rendered by courts, magistrates,

administrative tribunals, and professional oversight bodies with disciplinary

powers (e.g., law societies) can be useful sources of information.

When using the internet to glean customer reputation information, care must

be taken when researching news and quasi-news websites. Steps should

always be taken to verify, from more than one source, the accuracy of

negative news articles to reduce the risk of relying solely on a writer’s opinion.

Journalists have their own biases, as do their employers, and these biases can

subtly find their way into news articles. In addition, in countries where freedom

of speech and press are not well established, journalists are not always free to

write exactly what they would like. This often takes the form of prominently

publicizing negative news about someone who is not in favor with the

government (including what could be politically motivated criminal or civil

charges) or downplaying negative news about someone in favor with the

government. Not all media is corrupt, but sometimes the source has as much

at stake as the subject of the news. This is why investigators must take a close

look at the source of the news as well as the news itself, and why getting

multiple sources is important to ensure a complete understanding of the

story. Some sources might have limited parts of the whole story, which only is
revealed when the investigator has additional pieces of information.

When dealing with a country or region that is known to have tighter controls

on what is published on the internet and to restrict the amount of information

that is publicly accessible, it may be necessary to seek additional assistance.

Particularly when dealing with a valuable customer that justifies the additional
expense, an organization can retain the services of a vendor with expertise in

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 352

Version 6.44

this area to verify whether serious adverse information about a customer is in

fact supported by independent sources.

Tips on searching the internet

Before searching the internet, the investigator should prepare a plan, focusing
on the topics under investigation and the types of information needed. This

will ensure that the work is undertaken in an efficient and focused manner,
with the relevant records retained (e.g., screen capture or downloads due to

the risk of website changes).

The investigator should start with a metasearch using several different search
engines and then move to specific search engines with different capabilities.

From the metasearch, the investigator can start narrowing the parameters

using keywords. The plan devised in advance will help the investigator select

the keywords and areas where greater focus should be applied. For example,

if a customer’s transaction activity has raised concerns, the search could

begin with the customer’s personal and professional background and then

focus on the nature of the commercial activities she has been undertaking.

This will assist the investigator in assessing whether the transactions appear to

be consistent with the reasons given by the customer for opening the

account and the expected commercial activity she proposed to use it for.

There are high-quality tutorials on the web for individuals who want to

improve their search skills. There are also sites that identify search engines for

professional researchers. The easiest and most effective way to improve your

web-searching skills is to read the Help pages of major search engines and to

practice with their advanced features.

Some tips on search engines include:

•  Using multiple search engines is effective, because no single engine covers

the entire web.

•

If you are searching in a foreign country, use a local search engine.

•  Use metasearch engines.

An additional step is to access a commercial database. Although these

databases require the payment of a fee, public record aggregators can be

cost-effective, because they cross-reference an enormous number of

records. Moreover, they can include certain personally identifiable

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 353

Version 6.44

information, such as date of birth and government identification number,

which might not be located on the internet.

Search scenario: Too much money. Consider the case of a gas station
owner who deposits US$50,000 in cash per week. Is this money
laundering? Would simply searching the owner’s name on Google be

considered sufficient due diligence? A better approach would be to search

how much cash gas stations of that size and location typically deposited.
This leads to a very different line of inquiry. Internet sources might reveal

sources such as marketing studies, commercial valuation sites, and

businesses for sale that could provide useful clues about the cash flow of
comparable gas stations.

The internet might also reveal useful information about the area in which

the gas station is located, such as population statistics, income levels,

ethnicity, and crime rates. Is it located on a commuting corridor? Are there

competitors nearby? Does it have a car wash or a convenience store

attached?

By comparing the business with others and examining the context, it

becomes possible to argue that there is “…a high level of cash deposits

atypical of the expected business profile”—a classic indicator of money

laundering.

Search scenario: Unknown business. A bank client was depositing large
amounts of cash in his personal account. The bank suspected that its client

was operating an unlicensed money remittance service out of the back of

his restaurant. It was about to file a SAR when the bank realized that it was

missing a key piece of information: the name of the client’s restaurant. How

did the bank solve the mystery? It began by assuming that the client’s

restaurant was near the bank. Using a simple online telephone directory,

the bank was able to generate a list of all the restaurants within one mile of

the bank.

But which one belonged to the client? The bank needed a way to search

incorporation records for each of the businesses that it had identified. Not

wanting to use a commercial service, it went to a free online public records

provider. Clicking on the jurisdiction and then the link for corporations led

the bank to the right government department, where it input the name of

each one of the area restaurants until it found one with its customer listed

as a director.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 354

Version 6.44

This case provides a useful example of the benefits of starting an

investigation and then focusing on more specific areas to gain a complete
understanding of the customer being investigated.

Search scenario: Unusual bank account activity. What technical skills are
useful for KYC and due diligence? The following simple scenario can be

used to consider how to approach an investigation. You are asked to

research a customer named Cynthia Jenkins in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Transaction monitoring raised an alert that Cynthia appeared to be using

her account in a way that was inconsistent with what was expected when

she first opened the account—or maybe the account had been dormant
for some time and had suddenly reactivated. Transaction monitoring

showed that Cynthia’s account had received a significant number of wire
transfers from different parties in the past two weeks. Each transfer was

for US$9,900. When Cynthia first opened the account, she stated that it

was for “household expenses.”

Your first step might be to confirm Cynthia’s identity and search the

internet to determine whether the use of the account appears to be

legitimate, for example:

•

Is she listed in the telephone directory or on the electoral roll?

•  Where does Cynthia live? Is there any evidence that the property is used
for any commercial activity that could justify the payments received?

•

Is she mentioned in any other public records? Try a public records search

engine.

•  What information does she provide on social media about her occupation,

location, and other aspects of her life?

•

Is there evidence that someone could be misusing Cynthia’s account? For

example, is she elderly or possibly deceased? Could this be a case of

identity theft? Imposters often use the Social Security numbers of

deceased people. In the United States, it is possible to check the Social

Security Death Index by searching for “Social Security Death Index.”

Information obtained from internet searches should be complimented by

internal documents and records held by the financial organization. For

example, who sent the transfers? From what banks? Do the transfers indicate

why the monies were paid? Is it possible to check the internet to see whether
there is any information about the payers?

Conducting the investigation (Case
example: Utilizing the internet when
conducting financial investigations)

Easy Cash Ltd. is a money services business (MSB) that has been a customer

of XYZ Bank Corp for seven months. During customer onboarding, Easy Cash

advised XYZ Bank that its customers would come from Europe and that it
would conduct an estimated 10 to 20 transactions on the account each

month.

During the regular transaction monitoring of its customers, XYZ Bank identified
possible anomalies with the Easy Cash transactions and initiated an

investigation.

The investigator reviewed Easy Cash’s KYC and transaction history. It also

used open-source intelligence (OSINT), i.e., information obtained from data

that is publicly available. OSINT is often used in financial crime investigations

and KYC processes to better understand key information related to

customers and their activities. It is often used in conjunction with internal and

closed sources and helps to analyze different aspects of cases using primary

and secondary information related to the investigation that could corroborate

or disprove concerns and information.

OSINT involves searching through a large variety of online sources, such as

social media, news sites, public registries, and websites, in a structured and

logical manner. It can involve the use of basic search strings to find data using

key terms or delve into more complex techniques involving artificial

intelligence-driven automation capabilities and external platforms to compile

and analyze data.

The investigator started with a web search of the name of the customer and

its ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) for potential adverse media. She also

searched the names of senders and recipients of transactions using key

words, for example, “money laundering” or “crime,” and Boolean operators

such as “AND” or “OR.” The investigator learned that one of the recipients of

several transactions was mentioned in multiple reliable media sources as

having ties to the Italian Mafia and using Italian restaurants for laundering

money.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 356

Version 6.44

She also accessed the home page of the customer and businesses

associated with the UBO. On the home page of Easy Cash, the investigator
discovered that the company was promoting its money transfer services in

the Middle East and East Africa and downplaying the need to provide KYC. She
also discovered that Easy Cash had a branch in Turkey. Because some of the

home page content was written in a language the investigator did not speak,

she used an online translation tool and identified it as Farsi, the language
spoken in Iran. The Farsi content promoted the services of Easy Cash to

transfer funds in various currencies, including US dollars. The investigator also

used an online map service to research the address of the Turkish branch and
discovered that it was located in a city near the Iranian border.

XYZ Bank quickly took steps to freeze and later close the account with Easy
Cash once it notified the finance intelligence unit (FIU) of its findings.

Key takeaways

•  OSINT is an effective tool for investigations.

•  OSINT uses various search engines and conducts key word searches.

•  Boolean operators enhance the effectiveness of an internet search.

•  Customers’ home pages can provide important information.

•  Online translation services can help you utilize foreign websites in

investigations.

•  Online map applications can verify locations and determine what is

physically near that location.

•  Report to your FIU when you suspect a customer is engaged in money

laundering.

SAR Decision-Making Process

The decision of whether or not to file a SAR often involves weighing the

aggravating and mitigating factors arising from the research conducted

during the investigative process. Financial organizations should draft

procedures that document the factors to consider when determining
whether a SAR filing is appropriate. Properly trained personnel in charge of

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 357

Version 6.44

investigating and reporting suspicious activities should have a clear and

concise procedure for escalating their findings to a compliance officer,
manager, or other staff member with authority to make the filing decision. The

final decision should be documented and supported by the reasoning that
was used to make the determination. Often, the reason not to file an SAR is as

important as the reason to file an SAR.

After the decision to file has been made, the organization should report the
activity to its regulatory agency, law enforcement, or both, as defined by the

applicable regulations within its jurisdiction. Many jurisdictions require SARs to

be filed within a specific number of days following the discovery of potentially
suspicious activity.

In many jurisdictions, it is a requirement to report certain information

regarding SARs to senior management and/or the board of directors. This

information could be limited to the number of reports filed, the dollar amounts

involved, and significant trends observed by compliance personnel. In some

cases, if the activity presents a significant or potentially ongoing risk to the

organization, the leaders should be notified so that high-level decisions can be

made regarding potential changes to systems, staffing, products, services, or
specific relationships maintained by the organization.

Filing a SAR

The decision to file a SAR should be the result of an accumulation of

aggravating factors and a lack of mitigating factors, in combination with the

knowledge of what is expected activity for the organization’s customer base,

product offerings, and geographical area of service. The SAR filing should

include the details of the suspicious activity and the related demographics, as

well as the reasons the organization finds the activity suspicious. The recipient

of the SAR does not have the intimate knowledge of what is expected activity

for a particular organizations, clients, and products, and will only benefit from

the inclusion of this information. In addition, any known typologies identified as

part of the review should be included in the filing as well.

If, following the investigation, the organization decides that it should file an

SAR, it should notify the investigators or prosecutors as soon as possible.

However, this might not be practical in certain jurisdictions due to the

continuous nature of the SAR process and the volume of reports filed by the

reporting organization. The establishment of a filing timeline in concert with
Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 358

Version 6.44

country guidelines is critical to avoiding organizational penalties and fines. The

failure to file timely reports is often cited in regulatory actions against financial
organizations. The AML/CFT officer or designee should keep senior

management and board members apprised of SAR filing metrics and any
significant issues resulting from those filings, especially items that pose a

regulatory or reputational risk to the organization.

Finally, the financial organization should maintain a record of the SAR and all
supporting documentation. Under the BSA record-retention requirements,

this information should be maintained for five years following the date the SAR

was filed.

Quality assurance and control

All financial organizations are required to file timely and complete SARs, and

the quality of the SARs can be an indication of the quality of a financial

organization’s AML/CFT program. Quality and consistency in the SAR

decision-making process is critical to ensuring the appropriate level of

oversight in the investigative process. A quality assurance (QA), or quality

control (QC), review helps to ensure that SAR filings are internally consistent,

the right decisions are being made, and high-priority issues are identified and

escalated to leadership. A strong QA/QC process is also needed to ensure

that SARs are completed according to all regulatory requirements. The larger

the scale of the financial organization, its staff, and where it is located all have

an impact on the QA/QC process. As a result, financial organizations that

implement a QA/QC process should document the requirements and

qualifications of QA/QC reviewers and regularly review the outcome of

QA/QC reviews to assess the quality of staff, training requirements, and the
general health of the program.

SAR filing oversight and escalation

An organization should have robust policies and procedures for documenting

the appropriate oversight of the investigation process and regulatory

reporting requirements. This should include specific actions to be taken, such

as escalation to senior management in cases in which a customer-facing

employee or individual in the AML/CFT chain of command is complicit or

willfully blind to suspicious financial activities.

Failing to report SARs (Case example:
Money laundering reporting officer)

Governments and regulators routinely enact laws and publish guidance to

ensure that professionals report suspicious activity within various business

functions in an effort to identify, manage, and mitigate money laundering and
other financial crimes.

In June 2021, the UK updated guidance on prosecuting “failure to disclose”
cases under section 330 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. It is now legal to

prosecute the offense of failing to report suspicious activity, even when the

suspected money laundering activities have not yet been determined. The

intention of the updated guidance is to encourage professionals to actively

report any suspicious activity to the authorities; in the UK, this would be the UK

financial intelligence unit (UKFIU).  The money laundering reporting officer

(MLRO), Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) officer, and other designated persons

“report” or “sign” as the reporter to their FIU. The boards of financial

organizations delegate such functions to these appropriately trained and

experienced people. A conviction for failure to disclose information on

suspected or determined money laundering activity can result in a five-year
prison sentence.

In July 2021, Dominic Thorncroft was given an 18-month suspended prison

sentence and ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work at Southwark Crown

Court, UK, for failing to alert the authorities to money laundering (i.e., not

reporting SARs), breaching money laundering regulations, and retaining a
wrongful credit.

Thorncroft was an MLRO for a money services business (MSB) and the former

chair of the Association of UK Payment Institutions. In that capacity, he worked
with lawmakers and financial regulators and provided AML advice and training.

An investigation by the Metropolitan Police found evidence linking Thorncroft

to a 2014 investment fraud. Thorncroft had allowed his MSB to be used by

fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and mainland China. In addition, he

knowingly transferred money to the fraudsters, despite the fact that one

individual was subject to a serious crime prevention order, which should have

stopped him from sending money overseas.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 360

Version 6.44

Investigators found that Thorncroft should have known or suspected that the

money passing through his business’s bank accounts was criminal property.
Despite his substantial knowledge and expertise of money laundering,

Thorncroft failed to alert the authorities to the suspicious activity and allowed
it to continue.

It was noted in court that “Thorncroft did not commit the fraud himself.

However, his actions have allowed £850,000 defrauded from 60 individuals to
be dispersed across the world.” Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-

money laundering expert, but he did not follow the standards he set for

others. When his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property,
he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the

authorities.

Key takeaways

•  Designated persons must ensure that suspicious activity is identified and
reported through SARs to FIUs, to protect potential crime victims, their

firms, and themselves.

•  Designated persons must be held accountable, as they have a higher level
of knowledge and thus responsibility compared with others in businesses.

Failing to report SARs (Case example:
Deutsche Bank)

Suspicious activity reports (SARs) are routinely described by law enforcement

as the “lifeblood” of financial investigations. They contain intelligence related

to criminal financing and useful supporting contextual information. SARs can

be the catalyst for new investigations or a vital “piece of the puzzle” for an

existing investigation. Law enforcement officers rely on designated individuals

such as money laundering reporting officers (MLROs) and Bank Secrecy Act

(BSA) officers to identify and report suspicious behavior in a timely manner.

To fight financial crime, organizations must know the current reporting laws

and regulations and take responsibility for reporting suspicious activity. This

will protect the individual designated officers and the organization. The person

who detects the suspicious activity is responsible for reporting it internally for

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 361

Version 6.44

further development to establish whether the activity is suspicious. The

MLROs, BSA officer, or other designated officer “reports” or “signs” as the
reporter to the financial intelligence unit (FIU). At a higher level, the board

must ensure that the right people, technology, and processes are in place to
meet the reporting requirement. Reporting is genuinely a collective

responsibility, but reporting to the FIU is the responsibility of the MLRO, BSA

officer, or designated officer.

People working in regulated sectors must exercise a greater level of diligence

by identifying and reporting any red flags that might indicate suspicious

activity. Regulators have taken action against numerous organizations for
failure to report suspicious activity.

In October 2020, Deutsche Bank received a €13.5 million administrative fine

for failing to submit SARs in a timely fashion. Deutsche Bank allegedly failed to

disclose more than one million suspicious money transfers with Danske Bank

Estonia, for which Deutsche Bank was the correspondent bank.

The money transfers occurred over a five-year period after a whistleblower at

Danske Bank flagged them as suspicious transactions. German prosecutors

launched an investigation to determine whether Deutsche Bank employees

had sanctioned these transactions and subsequently attempted to cover

them up. Deutsche Bank withdrew from its position as a correspondent bank

for Danske Bank Estonia over increasing concerns about potential misconduct

by Danske Bank and launched two internal investigations into the matter

under the scrutiny of US regulators.

Frankfurt prosecutors cleared Deutsche Bank of money laundering, but found

that, between 2010 and 2015, Deutsche Bank failed to send timely alerts of

potentially suspicious transactions to law enforcement authorities on 627

occasions. For each of these failures, Deutsche Bank was fined between

€12,500 and €30,000.

Key takeaways

•  Failure to report suspicious transactions can result in fines and other

penalties.

•  People working in regulated sectors must exercise a greater level of

diligence by identifying and reporting any red flags that trigger suspicion.

•  Financial organizations are required to report suspicious activity by filing

SARs with FIUs.

Closing the Account

Based on its internal investigation, the financial organization should

independently determine whether to close the account in issue. Following are

important factors the organization should consider:

•  The legal basis for closing an account

•  The organization’s stated policies and procedures for closing an account,
which might include an automatic closure recommendation following a

specified number of SAR filings

•  The seriousness of the underlying conduct; that is, if the conduct rises to

the level of seriousness at which it would typically be closed, the

organization should consider closing it

•  The reputational risk to the organization posed by maintaining the account

•  Correspondence with law enforcement and requests from law

enforcement to either cancel or maintain the account

Version 6.44

Communicating with Law Enforcement on
SARs

When an organization files an SAR, the details of that filing might warrant

additional law enforcement notification. SARs represent financial intelligence

to a country’s FIU; depending on the volume of reports filed in a given country,
a report worthy of priority attention could be lost in the large number of

reports filed. Following the filing of the SAR, the responsible compliance
officer or designee can contact a specific law enforcement division to notify it

of the recent filing and make it aware of activity relevant to its area of

coverage or geographical location. Moreover, a law enforcement agent can
contact the financial organization that filed the SAR to seek the underlying

information used in the investigation that resulted in the SAR. Therefore, it is

critical that each organization develop its own policies and procedures for
communicating with law enforcement regarding SARs.

Investigations Initiated by Law

Enforcement

Law enforcement agencies may initiate investigations against a financial

organization or contact financial organizations in the context of an

investigation involving a customer. Steps that law enforcement agencies can
take when conducting a money laundering investigation include:

•  Follow the money: When a law enforcement agency is aware of where
laundered money originated or where it ended, it is appropriate for the

agency to attempt to bring the two ends together and compile a

complete understanding of the flow of the funds.

•  Leverage the financial knowledge and due diligence information contained in

financial organizations: Through information sharing and transactional
reviews, a financial organization can assist law enforcement in identifying

the originating and ultimate destination of a subject’s funds. Furthermore,

the supporting documentation that was used to create a SAR or CDD file

may be used as evidence, whereas actual SARs may not be in many

jurisdictions.

•

Identify the unlawful activity: Most countries define money laundering in
terms of predicate offenses or specified unlawful activities. These activities

are usually very extensive and include many felony crimes, such as bribery,

extortion, racketeering, narcotics trafficking, and human trafficking. For a

money laundering case to result in a conviction, prosecutors need to

establish the flow of money and the existence of a predicate offense.

•  Review databases: FIU databases and commercial databases can provide

very useful and extensive financial information and provide leads regarding

which financial organizations to ask for assistance. Also, records, such as

Social Security information in the United States (i.e., tax-related

information), can be used to further identify subjects.

•  Review public records: Court records, corporate filings, and credit reports

can provide useful background information.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 365

Version 6.44

•  Review licensing and registration files: Files, such as records held by motor

vehicle departments and other registration databases, can provide
background information and useful leads.

•  Analyze the financial transactions and account activity of the target: Look
for the typical and expected transactions of the individual or entity based

on self-disclosures, income, and typical flows of funds by similarly situated

people. Financial organizations might be able to assist in identifying these
items. If the transactions are outside of the norm or stated level of activity,

analyze where the additional funds originated and the composition of the

unusual activity.

•  Review SARs that might involve any potential individual linked to the target,

transactions, or activity.

•

In cross-border cases, seek international assistance.

Decision to Prosecute a Financial
Organization for Money Laundering
Violations

•  When considering whether—or to what extent—to bring a case against an
organization involving money laundering-related charges, prosecutors

consider many factors, such as: The organization has a criminal history.

•  The organization has cooperated with the investigation.

•  The organization discovered and self-reported the money laundering-

related issues.

•  The organization has a comprehensive and effective AML/CFT program.

•  The organization has taken timely and effective remedial action.

•  There are civil remedies available that can serve as punishment.

•  Deterring wrongdoing by others is needed and will be served by a

prosecution.

•  Advice and recommendations from regulatory agencies and/or the FIU for

the jurisdiction is available.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 366

Version 6.44

Assuming the case is not simple or egregious, the decision to prosecute is

frequently determined by what the prosecutors believe was the intent of the
organization when it undertook the action in question.

Responding to a Law Enforcement
Investigation against a Financial
Organization

When a financial organization is confronted with a law enforcement

investigation or a regulatory agency, it should respond quickly and completely

to all requests. Failure to do so could cause unnecessary risk or damage to the

organization. If a request is overly broad or unduly intrusive, the organization

can attempt to narrow the request or even seek to contest the request, or

portions of the request, in court. However, under no circumstances should an

organization ignore or delay responding to a law enforcement inquiry or

request for documents.

Upon receipt of a law enforcement inquiry, the financial organization needs to

inform the appropriate senior management and designate an individual to

respond to all law enforcement requests, monitor the progress of the

investigation, and keep senior management, including the board of directors,

informed of the nature and progress of the investigation. Reports and other

information about an investigation should not be provided to any employees,

officers, or directors of the organization who might be implicated in the

investigation.

The financial organization should consider retaining qualified, experienced

legal counsel. Such counsel can guide the organization through the inquiry,

contest requests that are perceived as improper, and assist in negotiating
settlements, when necessary.

As described below, when an organization receives a subpoena, search

warrant, or similar law enforcement demand, or becomes aware of a

government-related investigation involving the organization, it should conduct

an inquiry of its own to determine the underlying facts, the organization’s
exposure, and what steps, if any, the organization should take.

Financial organizations should ensure that all grand jury subpoenas and other

information requests from government agencies are reviewed by senior

management and an investigations group or legal counsel to determine how
best to respond to the inquiry and whether the inquiry or the underlying

activity might pose a risk to the organization. In addition, the organization
should maintain centralized control over all requests and responses to ensure

that it responds to requests on a complete and timely basis and maintains a

complete record of information provided. This centralized record will also
assist in the organization’s internal investigation.

Vital information can be found in a wide variety of document types, including

internal memos, transactional documents, calendars, emails, financial records,

travel records, phone logs, signature cards, deposit tickets, checks, withdrawal

items, credit and debit memoranda, and loan records. Thus, the organization

must ensure that relevant documents are not altered, lost, or destroyed and

that all employees are advised of this fact. This can be done by a memo sent

to all relevant employees. However, if there is concern that such a memo

might prompt a particular employee to alter or destroy documents, that

situation must be managed separately.

The organization should also address its document destruction policy to

ensure that no documents are destroyed pursuant to that policy during the

investigation. It would not be a serious concern if documents relevant to a

government investigation were destroyed pursuant to a legitimate policy and

prior to obtaining knowledge of the investigation or receiving a subpoena. It

could, however, be a serious concern if such documents were destroyed for

any reason (even pursuant to a legitimate policy) once the organization was

notified about an investigation—even if no subpoena had yet been received.

The organization should ensure the integrity of original documents, while at

the same time minimizing disruption to the organization’s business. It must

ensure that an appropriate system is in place to organize, maintain, number,

secure, copy, and prepare the documents for production to the government

(or to the opposing party in civil litigation). The documents should be listed in

an index so that they can be found when needed.

A detailed privilege log should also be created as the documents are

gathered, and privileged documents should be separated from other
documents to help avoid inadvertent disclosure.

Cooperating with Law Enforcement During
an Investigation against a Financial
Organization

Providing investigators with the information they need to reach an

investigative conclusion might be the most effective way to terminate an

investigation before it has a devastating effect on the resources and

reputation of an organization. Cooperation could include making employees,

including corporate officers, available for interviews, and producing

documents without the requirement of a subpoena. It could also include a

voluntary disclosure by providing investigators with any report written by

counsel regarding the subject under investigation.

The organization should make every effort to maintain a positive relationship

with the investigators and prosecutors. At a minimum, a positive working

relationship will help the organization conduct an effective parallel internal

investigation and thereby position the organization to respond more

effectively to investigative and prosecutorial inquiries.

It is also important for the organization to try to learn how the investigators

and prosecutors view the facts. If they are incorrect about some of the facts,

the organization will have an opportunity to correct them. At a minimum, if the

organization is aware of the investigators’ and prosecutors’ concerns, it will be

in a better position to respond to them.

Obtaining Counsel for an Investigation
against a Financial Organization

Retaining counsel

In particularly large, important, or serious investigations, it might be
appropriate for the organization to retain legal counsel to assist in responding

to the investigation or advising the organization during the course of the

investigation. Many financial organizations, such as large banks and securities
dealers, have legal counsel on their staff. But many other organizations, such

as small MSBs, do not ordinarily have legal counsel on their payroll. In either
case, it is recommended that organizations hire or consult with experienced

external legal counsel when confronted with a government investigation of

the organization itself. If the organization is actually facing imminent criminal

prosecution or indictment, it needs an experienced attorney who specializes

in defending financial organizations in these matters.

Using in-house counsel will, of course, cost less, and in-house counsel will start

out with a better knowledge of the organization and its personnel, policies,

and procedures. However, if the conduct under investigation could involve or

lead to a criminal investigation or indictment, outside counsel could be more

appropriate.

If the organization determines that it is appropriate to involve counsel, in-

house or external, it should take appropriate measures to ensure that the

counsel is sufficiently experienced and knowledgeable regarding the factual

and legal issues involved. In addition, the organization should determine the

nature and scope of the role of counsel and ensure that senior management

is aware of and supports the involvement of counsel.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 370

Version 6.44

Attorney-client privilege applied to entities and individuals

In an internal investigation, all parties should be aware that attorneys for the

organization represent the entity and not its employees. Counsel should

understand these issues and conduct the internal investigation accordingly.
Work product and communications might be protected under attorney-client

privilege. There can be serious consequences when the interests of an entity
and its employees diverge or conflict, and when an employee implicates the

employer, or vice versa. In such cases, separate counsel could be required.

Dissemination of a written report by counsel

If counsel for the organization prepares a written report of an investigation,

the organization should take steps to not inadvertently waive the attorney-

client privilege by distributing the report to people who should not receive it.

Every page of the report should contain a statement that it is confidential and

subject to the attorney-client privilege and work-product privilege.

Copies of the report should be numbered, and a list of people who are given

copies to read it should be maintained. After a specific period of time, all

copies should be returned. Individuals who receive the report should be

instructed not to make notes on their copies. All copies should be maintained

in a file separate from regular organization files to maintain the highest level of
protection.

Notices to Employees as a Result of an
Investigation against a Financial
Organization

In investigations conducted by the government, employees should be

informed of the investigation and instructed not to directly produce corporate

documents. Rather, they should inform senior management or counsel of all

requests for documentation and provide the documents to them for

production. In that way, the organization knows what is being requested and

what has been produced. In addition, the organization can determine what, if

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 371

Version 6.44

any, requests should be contested. The same procedure should be followed

with requests for employee interviews.

Interviewing Employees as a Result of a Law
Enforcement Investigation against a
Financial Organization

In addition to securing and reviewing all relevant documentation, it is
important to interview all knowledgeable employees. These employees

should be interviewed as soon as possible so that their memories are fresh,

and they can direct management or counsel to relevant documents and
people on a timely basis.

In addition, the organization, usually counsel, should prepare employees who

expect to be interviewed by law enforcement investigators and debrief them

after their interviews. The former will help the employee understand how to

handle the process, and the latter will assist the organization in better

understanding the scope and direction of the government investigation. All

requests for employee interviews by law enforcement investigators should go

through a single person or centralized location.

Most employees are not accustomed to or comfortable with being

interviewed—either by law enforcement investigators or counsel for the

organization. Therefore, care should be taken to put them at ease to the

extent possible.

It is also helpful for interviews to be as noncontentious as possible.

Background and open-ended questions should be used at the beginning of

the interview, together with a nonconfrontational review of documents. When

necessary, more contentious questions should be delayed to the end of the
interview.

Version 6.44

Media Relations

The importance of public and media relations in defending an organization

should not be overlooked. Public perception is vital to an organization’s
success in maintaining public trust. If the facts are not on the institution’s side,

“no comment” might be the best response it can offer. Misleading or false

statements that attempt to indicate that the organization has no problems
and has done nothing wrong can worsen the situation. When such statements

are made by a publicly traded company, they can invite additional scrutiny by
regulatory and law enforcement agencies.

Media relations (Case example:
Cooperation with regulatory authorities to
reduce fine)

In October 2021, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined Credit

Suisse bank over £147 million for serious anti-financial crime (AFC) due

diligence failures related to loans that it provided to the Republic of

Mozambique. As part of its agreement, the bank also agreed to forgive

US$200 million of the corrupt debt, which created economic harm and a debt

crisis for Mozambique.

In its formal statement, the FCA emphasized that, although Credit Suisse was

aware that the corruption risk of government officials was high, the bank failed

to properly manage the associated financial crime risks within its emerging
markets business.

Between late 2012 and early 2016, Credit Suisse was given information that

should have revealed the unacceptably high risk of bribery associated with the

loans and bond exchange the bank provided to a Mozambique government-

sponsored project. To secure more favorable terms for the loans, kickbacks

estimated to be over US$50 million were paid to members of a Credit Suisse

unit who took steps to conceal these from the bank’s senior management.

The FCA concluded that there was insufficient challenge, scrutiny, and
investigation into significant red flags concerning the transactions, which

included bribery and corruption concerns over the contractor.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 373

Version 6.44

Credit Suisse agreed to pay US$475 million in fines and penalties as part of a

coordinated international resolution with criminal and civil authorities in the
United States, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The resolution included a

deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice. The FCA
stated that the debt relief provided to the Republic of Mozambique was taken

into account when determining the fine. In addition, the bank was awarded a

30% discount in the overall penalty due to their cooperation. Without this
cooperation, a significantly larger penalty would have been imposed.

Credit Suisse would also be subject to enhanced compliance and self-

reporting, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) would
appoint an independent third party to review compliance measures and

existing transactions involving weak and corruption-prone countries and
companies.

Key takeaways

•  Organizations need to have robust AFC policies and procedures in place

and ensure their proper execution

•  When systemic issues are discovered, cooperation with regulators can

lead to a reduction in fines and penalties

•  Regulators are cooperating globally to address AFC failures and associated

impacts

AML/CFT Cooperation between

Countries

FATF Recommendations on Cooperation
between Countries

Practices that restrict international cooperation between supervisory
authorities or FIUs when analyzing and investigating suspicious transactions

and money laundering crimes, confiscating assets, and extraditing accused

money launderers are serious obstacles to combating money laundering.

Recommendations 36 through 40 of FATF’s 40 Recommendations on

establishing and maintaining effective AML/CFT programs pertain specifically

to the international aspects of money laundering and terrorist financing

investigations. They address mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition,

confiscation of assets, and mechanisms to exchange information
internationally.

International Money Laundering Information
Network

The International Money Laundering Information Network (IMoLIN) serves as a

clearinghouse of money laundering information for the benefit of national and

international AML agencies. It was developed and is administered by the

Global Programme against Money Laundering, Proceeds of Crime, and the

Financing of Terrorism of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes on
behalf of the UN and other international organizations, including Interpol.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 375

Version 6.44

IMoLIN has five main features:

1.  Anti-Money Laundering International Database (AMLID): A compendium and
analysis of national AML laws and regulations, as well as information on

national contacts and authorities (the database is password protected)

2.  Reference data: Research and analysis, bibliography, conventions, legal

instruments, and model laws

3.  Country page: Full text of AML legislation, where available, and links to

national FIUs

4.  Calendar of events: Chronological listing of training events, conferences,

seminars, workshops, and other meetings in the AML field

5.  International norms and standards: Details UN conventions, model laws, and

other international standards

Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties

When evidence is required from another jurisdiction, a request can be made

for mutual legal assistance. Mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) provide a

legal basis for transmitting evidence that can be used for prosecution and

judicial proceedings. MLATs only involve two countries at a time. For example,

the Treaty between Canada and the Kingdom of Spain on Mutual Assistance in

Criminal Matters, which has been in force since March 3, 1995, defines criminal

matters as “investigations or proceedings relating to offenses concerning

taxation, duties, customs and international transfer of capital or payments.”

Moreover, it defines assistance as the “taking of evidence and obtaining of

statements of persons; provision of information, documents and other

records, including criminal records, judicial records and government records;

location of persons and objects, including their identification; search and

seizure; delivery of property, including lending of exhibits; making detained

persons and others available to give evidence or assist investigations; service

of documents, including documents seeking the attendance of persons;

measures to locate, restrain and forfeit the proceeds of crime; and other

assistance consistent with the objects of this Treaty.”

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 376

Version 6.44

Procedures can vary, but the typical process for requesting evidence from

another jurisdiction involves:

•  The central authority of the requesting country sends a commission

rogatoire (letters rogatory, or letter of request) to the central authority of
the other country. The letter includes the information sought, the nature of

the request, the criminal charges in the requesting country, and the legal

provision under which the request is made.

•  The central authority that receives the request sends it to a local financial

investigator to determine if the information is available.

•  An investigator from the requesting country then visits the country from
which the information is sought and accompanies the local investigator

during visits or when statements are taken.

•  The investigator asks the central authority for permission to remove the

evidence to the requesting country.

•  The central authority sends the evidence to the requesting central

authority, thereby satisfying the request for mutual legal assistance. Local

witnesses may need to attend court hearings in the requesting country.

Financial Intelligence Units

FIUs are mandatory national agencies that handle financial intelligence. They

receive reports of suspicious transactions from financial organizations, other

people, and entities, analyze them, and disseminate the resulting intelligence

to local law enforcement agencies and foreign FIUs to combat money
laundering.

The first FIUs were established in the early 1990s in response to the need for a

central agency to receive, analyze, and disseminate financial information to

combat money laundering.

The European FIUs established in the late 90s were predominantly

domestically organized and focused. However, to fight the threat posed by

criminals and terrorists exploiting the open borders of the EU, the FIUs of

Luxembourg, UK, Italy, and France joined the Dutch FIU in its initiative to create
a decentralized network for the FIUs to exchange information in a more

sophisticated way. With the start of the pilot project in 2004, FIU.net was born.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 377

Version 6.44

Starting in 2006, the former Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and

Security (DG JLS), later Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs
(DG HOME) of the European Commission, the Dutch Ministry of Justice and

Security, and the participating FIUs funded the EU FIU.net project, which lasted
a decade.

During that period the FIU.net Bureau and the project support team, together

with the FIUs, developed the FIU.net system into a sophisticated, effective tool
in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. During those

years, they added features to FIU.net, such as Ma3tch, a revolutionary way to

match and detect common subjects without exposing information that is not
relevant to others. In addition, the Templates feature makes it easy to adjust

the system to the specific needs of an individual FIU.

In 2012, FATF adopted a revised set of recommendations on combating

money laundering that, for the first time, included explicit recommendations

for the establishment and functioning of FIUs. Although the FIU members of

the Egmont Group share the same core functions of receiving, analyzing, and

disseminating financial information to combat money laundering and

financing of terrorism, they often differ in how they are established and how

they function. In 2016, the European Union initiated several measures to

strengthen the role of FIUs and their ability to share information across Europe
as part of its comprehensive action plan toward the fight against terrorism.

Three basic functions of an FIU

Receive

Analysis

Dissemination

FIUs play an important role in the AML/CFT framework. FATF

Recommendation 29 states that countries should establish an FIU that serves

as a national center for the receipt and analysis of: (a) suspicious transaction

reports and (b) other information relevant to money laundering, associated

predicate offenses, and terrorist financing, and for the dissemination of the

results of that analysis. FIUs should be able to obtain additional information

from reporting entities and have access on a timely basis to the financial,

administrative, and law enforcement information that it requires to undertake

its functions properly.

Articles 30 and 31 of the Recommendations outline the powers of FIUs and

other competent authorities responsible for conducting investigations:

•  Responsibility for money laundering and terrorist financing investigations

within the framework of national AML/CFT policies

•  At least in all cases related to major proceeds-generating offenses,
developing a proactive parallel financial investigation when pursuing

money laundering, associated predicate offenses, and terrorist financing,

including cases in which the associated predicate offense occurs outside

their jurisdictions

•  Expeditiously identifying, tracing, and initiating actions to freeze and seize
property that is or might become subject to confiscation, or is suspected

of being proceeds of crime

•  Access to all necessary documents and information for use in those

investigations and in prosecutions and related actions,

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 379

Version 6.44

including powers to use compulsory measures for the production of

records held by financial organizations, DNFBPs, and other natural or legal
persons for the search of people and premises, taking witness statements,

and seizing and obtaining evidence

•  Using a wide range of investigative techniques suitable for the investigation

of money laundering, associated predicate offenses, and terrorist

financing, including undercover operations, intercepting communications,
accessing computer systems, and controlled delivery.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), founded

in 1989, is Australia’s primary source for financial intelligence, which is used to
fight serious and organized crime and terrorism financing. The UK’s FIU is part

of the National Crime Agency (NCA). The NCA became operational in 2013

and leads UK law enforcement’s fight against serious and organized crime. In

the US, FinCEN was established in 1990 with the mission to safeguard the

financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering, and promote

national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial

intelligence and the strategic use of financial authorities.

FIUs are tasked with receiving and analyzing SARs and maintaining close links

with police and customs authorities. They share information among

themselves informally in the context of investigations, usually on the basis of

memoranda of understanding (MOU). The Egmont Group of FIUs has

established a model for MOUs. Unlike the MLATs, MOUs are not typically used

for obtaining evidence, but for obtaining intelligence that might lead to
evidence.

In June 2001, the members of the Egmont group adopted “Principles of

Information Exchange between Financial Intelligence Units” and incorporated

the document into its Statement of Purpose. Some countries can restrict the

exchange of information with other FIUs or the access to information

requested by an FIU. This document describes practices that maximize

cooperation among FIUs and can be useful to government authorities when

considering AML legislation.

Furthermore, to address practical issues that impede mutual assistance, the

document provides best practices for the exchange of information among

FIUs. When handling international information requests, FIUs are urged to take
these best practices into account.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 380

Version 6.44

Key principles included in the document include:

•  The Egmont principle of free exchange of information at the FIU level
should be possible on the basis of reciprocity, including spontaneous

exchange.

•  Differences in the definition of offenses that fall under the competence of
FIUs should not be an obstacle to the free exchange of information at the

FIU level. To this end, the FIU’s competence should extend to all predicate
offenses for money laundering, as well as terrorist financing.

•  The exchange of information among FIUs should take place as informally

and as rapidly as possible and with no excessive formal prerequisites, while
guaranteeing protection of privacy and confidentiality of the shared data.

•  When an FIU needs a memorandum of understanding to exchange

information, it should be negotiated and signed by the FIU without undue

delay. To that end, the FIU should have the authority to sign MOUs

independently.

•

It should be possible for communication among FIUs to take place directly,

without intermediaries.

•  Providing an FIU’s consent to disseminate the information for law

enforcement or judicial purposes should be granted promptly and to the

greatest extent possible. The FIU providing the information should not

deny permission to disseminate the information unless doing so would fall

beyond the scope of its AML/CFT provisions; could impair a criminal

investigation; would be clearly disproportionate to the legitimate interests

of an individual, legal person, or the country of the providing FIU; or would

otherwise not be in accord with basic principles of national law. Any refusal

to grant consent should be appropriately explained.

The following practices should be observed by the FIU requesting the

information:

•  All FIUs should submit requests for information in compliance with the
Principles of Information Exchange established by the Egmont Group.

When applicable, the provisions of information-sharing arrangements

among FIUs should also be observed.

•  Requests for information should be submitted as soon as the precise

assistance required is identified.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 381

Version 6.44

•  When an FIU has information that might be useful to another FIU, it should
consider supplying it spontaneously as soon as the relevance of sharing
this information is identified.

•  The exchange of information among Egmont FIUs should take place in a
secure way. To this end, the Egmont FIUs should use the Egmont Secure

Web (ESW) when appropriate.

The Egmont Group released a revised charter that built on the original one
and included updates to:

•  Unite efforts to improve an effective exchange of information upon

request and spontaneously to combat money laundering and financing of
terrorism.

•  Exchange information on their respective experiences to promote the

development of effective FIUs.

•  Support the Egmont Group members to enhance their capacity by
promoting operational independence of FIUs, offering training and

technical assistance, promoting personnel exchanges, developing

operational and strategic collaboration, and maintaining and granting

access to a secure channel for information exchange among Egmont

Group FIUs.

An example of FIUs collaborating and utilizing MOUs was in October 2013,

when FinCEN and Mexico’s National Banking and Securities Commission

executed the first-ever MOU to facilitate the exchange of supervisory

information in support of both agencies’ AML/CFT missions. Moreover, it

provided for strict controls and safeguards to ensure that shared information

is well protected and used in a confidential and authorized manner for

AML/CFT supervision purposes only.

Additional Study Resources

This section cites several CAMS Examination supporting documents and
reference materials. It also suggests websites and periodicals that offer

additional supporting material. Several international bodies that are focused

on AML/CFT have published valuable guidance documents and reference
materials that are helpful in preparing for the CAMS Examination.

For study purposes, generally the reference documents have an introduction,

putting the material in context and, in some cases, describing the

methodology behind their production. For example, in each of FATF’s Risk-

Based Approach Guidance documents, the purpose of the risk-based

approach is explained in the opening chapter. The core material then

describes the specific AML risks that are the focus of the guidance and

describes the best practices for mitigating those risks. It is this core material
that is examined in the CAMS Examination.

Two documents above all others (FATF’s 40 Recommendations and

Interpretive Notes) should receive particular study from CAMS candidates. It is

highly advised to download the free .pdf versions available from the FATF

website to keep with your other CAMS study materials. The 40

Recommendations are the basic elements of every AML regime at the

national and financial institution levels and most of the other materials build off

specific aspects of this foundation.

Glossary

Affidavit

A written statement given under oath before an officer of the court,

notary public or other authorized person. It is commonly used as the

factual basis for an application for a search, arrest or seizure warrant.

Alternative remittance system (ARS)

Underground banking or informal value transfer systems (IVTS). Often

associated with ethnic groups from the Middle East, Africa or Asia, and

commonly involves the transfer of values among countries outside of

the formal banking system. The remittance entity can be an ordinary

shop selling goods that has an arrangement with a correspondent

business in another country. There is usually no physical movement of

currency and a lack of formality with regard to verification and record

keeping. The money transfer takes place by coded information that is

passed through chits, couriers, letters, faxes, emails, text messages or

online chat systems, followed by some form of telecommunications

confirmations.

Anti-Money Laundering International Database (AMLID)

A compendium of analyses of anti-money laundering laws and

regulations, including two general classes of money laundering control

measures—domestic laws and international cooperation—as well as

information on national contacts and authorities. A secure, multilingual

database, AMLID is an important reference tool for law enforcement

officers involved in cross-jurisdictional work.

Anti-money laundering program

The system designed to assist institutions in their fight against money

laundering and terrorist financing. In many jurisdictions, government

regulations require financial institutions, including banks, securities

dealers and money services businesses, to establish such programs. At

a minimum, the anti-money laundering program should include

Arrest warrant

A court order directing a law enforcement officer to seize and detain a

particular person and require him or her to provide an answer to a

complaint or otherwise appear in court.

Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG)

A Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-style regional body consisting of

jurisdictions in the Asia/Pacific Region.

Asset protection

A process that includes reorganizing how assets are held in order to

make them less vulnerable should a claim be made against a person.

Asset protection is also a term used by tax planners for measures taken

to protect assets from taxation in other jurisdictions.

Asset protection trusts (APTs)

A special form of irrevocable trust usually created (i.e., settled) offshore

for the principal purposes of preserving and protecting part of one’s

wealth from creditors. Title to the asset is transferred to a person

named the trustee. APTs are generally used for asset protection and

are usually tax neutral. Their ultimate function is to provide for the

beneficiaries. Some proponents advertise APTs as allowing foreign

trustees to ignore U.S. court orders and to simply transfer the trust to

another jurisdiction in response to legal action threatening the trust’s

assets.

Automated Clearing House (ACH)

An electronic banking network that processes large volumes of both

credit and debit transactions that originate in batches. ACH credit

transfers include direct deposit payroll payments and payments to

contractors and vendors. ACH debit transfers include consumer

payments on insurance premiums, mortgage loans and other kinds of

expenses.

Automated teller machine (ATM)

An electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic

transactions without the assistance of a bank employee. ATMs generally

dispense cash, allow check and cash deposits and transfers to be

made, as well as balance inquiries.

Bank draft

Vulnerable to money laundering because it represents a reputable

international monetary instrument drawn on a reputable institution, and

is often made payable—in cash—upon presentation and at the issuing

institution’s account in another country.

Bank secrecy

Refers to laws and regulations in countries that prohibit banks from

disclosing information about an account—or even revealing its

existence—without the consent of the account holder. Impedes the

flow of information across national borders among financial institutions

and their supervisors. One of FATF’s 40 Recommendations states that

countries should ensure that secrecy laws do not inhibit the

implementation of the FATF Recommendations.

Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)

The primary U.S. anti-money laundering regulatory statute (Title 31, U.S.

Code Sections 53115355) enacted in 1970 and most notably amended

by the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001. Among other measures, it imposes

money laundering controls on financial institutions and many other

businesses, including the requirement to report and to keep records of

various financial transactions.

Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance program

A program that U.S.-based financial institutions—as defined by the Bank

Secrecy Act—are required to establish and implement in order to

control money laundering and related financial crimes. The program’s

components include at a minimum: the development of internal

policies, procedures and controls; the designation of a compliance

officer; ongoing employee training and an independent audit function

to test the program.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)

The Basel Committee was established by the G-10’s central bank of

governors in 1974 to promote sound supervisory standards worldwide.

Its Secretariat is appointed by the Bank for International Settlements in

Basel, Switzerland. It has issued, among others, papers on customer

due diligence for banks, consolidated KYC risk management,

transparency in payment messages, due diligence and transparency

regarding cover payment messages related to cross-border wire

transfers and sharing of financial records among jurisdictions in

connection with the fight against terrorist financing. See

Bearer form

In relation to a certificate, share transfer or other document, a bearer

form enables a designated investment or deposit to be sold,

transferred, surrendered or addressed to a bearer without the need to

obtain further written instructions.

Bearer negotiable instruments

Includes monetary instruments in bearer form such as: negotiable

instruments (including checks, promissory notes and money orders)

that are either in bearer form, are endorsed without restriction, are

made out to a payee or are otherwise in such form that title thereto

passes upon delivery.

Bearer share

Negotiable instruments that accord ownership in a corporation to the

person who is in physical possession of the bearer share certificate, a

certificate made out to Bearer and not in the name of an individual or

organization.

Benami account

Also called a nominee account. Held by one person or entity on behalf

of another or others, Benami accounts are associated with the hawala

underground banking system of the Indian subcontinent. A person in

one jurisdiction seeking to move funds through a hawaladar to another

jurisdiction may use a Benami account or Benami transaction to

disguise his or her true identity or the identity of the recipient of the

funds.

Beneficial owner

The term beneficial owner has two different definitions depending on

the context.

Bill stuffing

A casino customer goes to various slot machines putting cash in the bill

acceptors and collects cash-out tickets with nominal gaming activity,

then cashes out at the casino cage or asks for a check.

Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE)

The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is an example of a complex

method of trade-based money laundering. The BMPE originally was

driven by Colombia’s restrictive policies on currency exchange. To

circumvent those policies, Colombian businesses bypassed the

government levies by dealing with peso brokers that dealt in the black

market or parallel financial market. Colombian drug traffickers took

advantage of this method to receive Colombian pesos in Colombia in

exchange for U.S. drug dollars located in the U.S.

Cardholder

Person to whom a financial transaction card is issued, or an additional

person authorized to use the card.

Casa de cambio

Also called a bureau de change or an exchange office, a casa de

cambio offers a range of services that are attractive to money

launderers: currency exchange and consolidation of small

denomination bank notes into larger ones; exchange of financial

instruments such as travelers checks, money orders and personal

checks; and telegraphic transfer facilities.

Cash collateralized loans

A cash collateralized loan has cash deposits as the loan’s collateral. The

cash deposits can sometimes reside in another jurisdiction.

Cash deposits

Sums of currency deposited in one or more accounts at a financial

institution. Vulnerable to money laundering in the placement phase, as

criminals move their cash into the noncash economy by making

deposits into accounts at financial institutions.

Cashier’s check

Common monetary instrument often purchased with cash. Can be

used for laundering purposes, cashier’s checks provide an instrument

drawn on a financial institution.

Cash-intensive business

Any business in which customers usually pay with cash for the products

or services provided, such as restaurants, pizza delivery services, taxi

firms, coin-operated machines or car washes. Some money launderers

run or use cash-based businesses to commingle illegally obtained

funds with cash actually generated by the business.

CICAD (Comisión Interamericana para el Control del Abuso de Drogas or

Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission)

CICAD has issued several sets of anti-money laundering

recommendations, including amendments to the Organization of

American States (OAS) Model Regulations issued in 1992.

CICAD (Spanish: Comisión Interamericana para el Control del Abuso de

Drogas)

See Organization of American States—Inter-American Drug Abuse

Control Commission.

Collection accounts

Immigrants from foreign countries deposit many small amounts of

currency into one account where they reside, and the collected sum is

transferred to an account in their home country without

documentation of the sources of the funds. Certain ethnic groups from

Asia or Africa may use collection accounts to launder money.

Commission rogatoire

Also known as letters rogatory, a commission rogatoire is a written

request for legal or judicial assistance sent by the central authority of

one country to the central authority of another when seeking evidence

from the foreign jurisdiction. The letter typically specifies the nature of

the request, the relevant criminal charges in the requesting country, the

legal provision under which the request is made, and the information

sought.

Concentration account

Also called an omnibus account. Held by a financial institution in its

name, a concentration account is used primarily for internal

administrative or bank-to-bank transactions in which funds are

transmitted and commingled without personally identifying the

originators.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 396

Version 6.44

Concentration risk

Concentration risk primarily applies to the asset side of the balance

sheet. As a common practice, supervisory authorities not only require

financial institutions to have information systems to identify credit

concentrations, but also set limits to restrict bank exposure to single

borrowers or groups of related borrowers. On the liability side,

concentration risk is associated with funding risk, especially the risk of

early and sudden withdrawal of funds by large depositors that could

harm an institution’s liquidity.

Confidentiality

Keeping certain facts, data and information out of public or

unauthorized view. In most jurisdictions, confidentiality is required when

filing suspicious transaction or activity reports —the filing institution’s

employees cannot notify a customer that a report has been filed. In

another context, a breach of confidentiality can occur when an

institution discloses client information to enforcement agencies or a

financial intelligence unit in violation of the jurisdiction’s bank secrecy

laws.

Confiscation

Includes forfeiture where applicable, and means the permanent

deprivation of funds or other assets by order of a competent authority

or a court. Confiscation or forfeiture takes place through a judicial or

administrative procedure that transfers the ownership of specified

funds or other assets to the state. Upon transfer, the individual(s) or

entity(ies) that held an interest in the specified funds or other assets at

the time of the confiscation or forfeiture lose all rights, in principle, to

the confiscated or forfeited assets.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 397

Version 6.44

Corporate vehicles

Types of legal entities that may be subject to misuse such as private

limited companies and public limited companies whose shares are not

traded on a stock exchange, trusts, nonprofit organizations, limited

partnerships and limited liability partnerships and private investment

companies. Occasionally, it is difficult to identify the people who are the

ultimate beneficial owners and controllers of corporate vehicles, which

makes the vehicles vulnerable to money laundering.

Correspondent banking

The provision of banking services by one bank (the correspondent

bank) to another bank (the respondent bank). Large international banks

typically act as correspondents for hundreds of other banks around the

world. Respondent banks may be provided with a wide range of

services, including cash management (e.g., interest-bearing accounts

in a variety of currencies), international wire transfers of funds, check

clearing services, payable-through accounts and foreign exchange

services.

Credit cards

A plastic card with a credit limit used to purchase goods and services

and to obtain cash advances on credit. The cardholder is subsequently

billed by the issuer for repayment of the credit extended. Credit cards

may be used to launder money when payments of the amounts owed

on the card are made with criminal money.

Criminal proceeds

Any property derived from or obtained, directly or indirectly, through

the commission of a crime.

Cross border

Used in the context of activities that involve at least two countries, such

as wiring money from one country to another or taking currency across

a border.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 398

Version 6.44

Currency

Banknotes and coins that are in circulation as a medium of exchange.

Currency smuggling

The illicit movement of large quantities of cash across borders, often

into countries without strict banking secrecy, poor exchange controls

or poor anti-money laundering legislation.

Currency transaction report (CTR)

A report that documents a physical currency transaction that exceeds

a certain monetary threshold. A CTR can also be filed on multiple

currency transactions that occur in one day exceeding the required

reporting amount. Some countries, including the U.S., have

requirements addressing when CTRs should be filed with government

authorities.

Custodian

A bank, financial institution or other entity that is responsible for

managing, administering or safekeeping assets for other people or

institutions. A custodian holds assets to minimize risk of theft or loss,

and does not actively trade or handle the assets.

Custody

The act of or authority to safeguard and administer clients’ investments

or assets.

Customer due diligence (CDD)

In terms of money laundering controls, CDD requires policies, practices

and procedures that enable a financial institution to predict with relative

certainty the types of transactions in which the customer is likely to

engage. CDD includes not only establishing the identity of customers,

but also establishing a baseline of account activity to identify those

transactions that do not conform to normal or expected transactions.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 399

Version 6.44

Debit card

A card that permits an account holder to draw funds from an existing

account. Debit cards are used to pay obligations or make purchases.

Debit cards can be used in a variety of places, including on the Internet.

Debit cards often allow for movement of cash via cash-back

transactions or withdrawals at ATMs.

Designated Categories of Offense

Those crimes considered by FATF to be money-laundering predicate

offenses. Each country can separately decide how it will define specific

offenses and their elements under its own domestic laws. Many nations

do not specify which crimes can serve as predicates for laundering

prosecutions and merely state that all serious felonies may be

predicates.

Designated nonfinancial businesses and professions

FATF recommends certain standards apply to nonfinancial businesses

and professions, including specifically

•  casinos (including Internet casinos);

•

real estate agents;

•  dealers in precious metals and precious stones;

•

•

lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants

(Refers to those who prepare or carry out certain duties on behalf of

clients); and

trust and company service providers who prepare or carry out certain

duties on behalf of their clients.

Domestic transfer

Electronic funds transfer in which the originator and beneficiary

institutions are located in the same jurisdiction. A domestic transfer

therefore refers to any chain of wire transfers that takes place entirely

within the borders of a single jurisdiction, even though the actual

system used to send the wire transfer may be located in another

jurisdiction or online.

Eastern and Southern African Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG)

An FATF-style regional body comprising countries from the Eastern

region of Africa down to the Southern tip of Africa, established in 1999.

Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units

The Egmont Group consists of numerous national financial intelligence

units (FIUs) that meet regularly to find ways to promote the

development of FIUs and to cooperate, especially in the area of

information exchange, training and the sharing of expertise. The goal of

the group is to provide a forum for FIUs to improve cooperation in the

fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and to

foster the implementation of domestic programs in this field.

Electronic funds transfer (EFT)

The movement of funds between financial institutions electronically.

The two most common electronic funds transfer systems in the U.S. are

FedWire and CHIPS. (SWIFT is often referred to as the third EFT system,

but in reality it is an international messaging system that carries

instructions for wire transfers between institutions, rather than the wire

transfer system itself.)

Electronic money (emoney)

Electronic cash represents a series of monetary value units in some

electronic format, such as being stored electronically online, on the

hard drive of a device or on the microchip of a plastic card.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 401

Version 6.44

Enhanced due diligence (EDD)

In conjunction with customer due diligence, EDD calls for additional

measures aimed at identifying and mitigating the risk posed by higher

risk customers. It requires developing a more thorough knowledge of

the nature of the customer, the customer’s business and

understanding of the transactions in the account than a standard or

lower risk customer. A financial institution should ensure account

profiles are current and monitoring should be risk-based.

Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of

Terrorism (EAG)

An FATF-style regional body formed in October 2004 in Moscow.

European Union (EU)

The modern EU was founded in the Treaty of Maastricht on European

Union, signed in 1992 and effective in 1993. The EU is a politico-

economic union of member states located primarily in Europe. Member

states have set up three common institutions (the European

Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of the European

Union) to which they delegate part of their sovereignty so that

decisions on specific matters of collective interest can be made

democratically at the European level. As a result, people, goods,

services and money flow freely through the EU.

European Union Directive on Prevention of the Use of the Financial

System for the Purpose of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing

First adopted by the European Union in June 1991 and updated in 1997,

2005 and 2015, the Directive requires EU member states to ensure that

money laundering and terrorist financing are prohibited. The Directive

applies to a broad spectrum of entities, including financial institutions,

accountants, notaries, trust companies, estate agents and some

providers of gambling services. Member states are expected to identify

and mitigate risks appropriately. They are to oversee financial

institutions and other obliged entities, including establishing standards

for customer due diligence, prohibition of shell banking relationships,

establishing FIUs, developing standards for document retention and

requiring consequences for failure to comply.

Europol

Europol is the EU’s law enforcement agency. Its main goal is to help

achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens. In the area of

anti-money laundering, Europol provides member states’ law

enforcement authorities with operational and analytical support via the

Europol liaison officers (ELOs) and its analysts, as well as state-of-the-

art databases and communication channels.

Express trust

A trust created expressly by the settlor, usually in the form of a

document such as a written deed of trust. An express trust differs from

trusts that do not result from the specific intent or decision of a settlor

to create a trust (e.g., constructive trust established by a court of law to

address undeclared property).

Extradition

The surrender by one jurisdiction to another of an accused or convicted

person under an agreement that specifies the terms of such

exchanges.

Extraterritorial reach

The extension of one country’s policies and laws to the citizens and

institutions of another. Depending on jurisdiction, money laundering

laws may extend prohibitions and sanctions into other jurisdictions.

Financial Action Task Force (FATF)

FATF was chartered in 1989 by the Group of Seven industrial nations to

foster the establishment of national and global measures to combat

money laundering. It is an international policy making body that sets

anti-money laundering standards and counter-terrorist financing

measures worldwide. Its Recommendations do not have the force of

law. Thirty-five countries and two international organizations are

members. In 2012, FATF substantially revised its 40 + 9

Recommendations and reduced them to 40. FATF develops annual

typology reports showcasing current money laundering and terrorist

financing trends and methods. See www.fatf-gafi.org.

Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering in Latin America

(GAFILAT)

An FATF-style regional body for Latin America, established in 2000.

Financial Action Task Force-Style Regional Body (FSRB)

FSRBs have forms and functions similar to those of FATF. However, their

efforts are targeted to specific regions. In conjunction with FATF, FSRBs

constitute an affiliated global network to combat money laundering and

terrorist financing.

Financial intelligence unit (FIU)

Version 6.44

Forfeiture

The involuntary loss of property or assets as a result of legal action.

Generally, the owner of the property that has failed to comply with the

law or the property is linked to some sort of criminal activity.

Freeze

To prevent or restrict the exchange, withdrawal, liquidation or use of

assets or bank accounts. Unlike forfeiture, frozen property, equipment,

funds or other assets remain the property of the natural or legal people

that held an interest in them at the time of the freezing and may

continue to be administered by third parties. The courts may decide to

implement a freeze as a means to protect against flight.

Front company

Any business set up and controlled by another organization. Although

not necessarily illicit, criminals use front companies to launder money

by giving the funds the appearance of legitimate origin. Front

companies may subsidize products and services at levels well below

market rates or even below manufacturing costs.

GAFISUD (Spanish: Grupo de Acción Financiera de Sudamérica)

See Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering in Latin America.

Gatekeepers

Professionals, such as lawyers, notaries, accountants, investment

advisors and trust and company service providers, who assist in

transactions involving the movement of money and are deemed to

have a particular role in identifying, preventing and reporting money

laundering. Some countries impose due diligence requirements on

gatekeepers that are similar to those of financial institutions.

Grantor

The party who transfers title or ownership of property or assets. In a

trust, typically the person who creates or funds the trust.

states in the fields of economy and industry. Member states include

Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab

Emirates. The GCC is a member of FATF, although its individual

members are not.

Hawala

An informal value transfer system common in the Middle East, North

Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The system operates outside

traditional banking systems. In a basic form, a customer contacts a

hawaladar and gives him or her money to be transferred to another

person. The hawaladar contacts his or her counterpart where the

second person lives, who remits the funds to that person. A running tally

is kept between the hawaladars of which owes the other a net sum.

See alternative remittance system.

Hawaladar

A hawala broker.

Human smuggling

Human smuggling refers to the transport or illegal entry of a person

across international borders in contravention of one or more countries’

laws. Human smuggling differs from human trafficking in that it focuses

on the entry or transport, rather than the exploitation, of the person

involved.

Human trafficking

Also known as Trafficking in Persons. The trade of humans, most

commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labor or

commercial sexual exploitation. Trafficking occurs in almost every

country in the world and is often cited as the second-largest criminal

enterprise in the world.

Integration

The integration phase, often referred to as the third and last stage of

the classic money laundering process, places laundered funds back

into the economy by re-entering the funds into the financial system

and giving them the appearance of legitimacy.

International business company (IBC)

A variety of offshore corporate structures that are dedicated to

business use outside the incorporating jurisdiction and feature rapid

formation, secrecy, broad powers, low cost, low-to-zero taxation and

minimal filing and reporting requirements.

International Monetary Fund (IMF)

An organization of more than 180 member countries, the IMF works to

foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate

international trade, promote high employment and sustainable

economic growth and reduce poverty around the world. The

organization’s objectives have remained unchanged since it was

established. Its operations, which involve surveillance, financial

assistance and technical support, have adjusted to meet the changing

needs of member countries.

Know your customer (KYC)

Know your employee (KYE)

Anti-money laundering policies and procedures for acquiring a better

knowledge and understanding of the employees of an institution for

the purpose of detecting conflicts of interests, money laundering, past

criminal activity and suspicious activity.

Knowledge

Mental state accompanying a prohibited act. The Interpretive Notes to

Recommendation 3 of the FATF 40 Recommendations of 2012 say that

countries should ensure that the intent and knowledge required to

prove the offense of money laundering is consistent with the standards

set forth in the Vienna and Palermo Conventions, including the concept

that such a mental state may be inferred from objective factual

circumstances. The exact definition of knowledge that accompanies an

anti-money laundering act varies by country. Knowledge can be

deemed, under certain circumstances, to include willful blindness; that

is “the deliberate avoidance of knowledge of the facts,” as some courts

have defined the term.

Layering

The second phase of the classic three-step money laundering process

between placement and integration, layering involves distancing illegal

proceeds from their source by creating complex levels of financial

transactions designed to disguise the audit trail and to provide

anonymity.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

Legal risk

Defined by the 2001 Basel Customer Due Diligence for Banks paper as

the possibility that lawsuits, adverse judgments or contracts that cannot

be enforced may disrupt or harm a financial institution. In addition,

banks can suffer administrative or criminal penalties imposed by the

government. A court case involving a bank may have graver

implications for the institution than just the legal costs. Banks will be

unable to protect themselves effectively from such legal risks if they do

not practice due diligence in identifying customers and understanding

and managing their exposure to money laundering.

Letter of credit

A credit instrument issued by a bank that guarantees payments on

behalf of its customer to a third party when certain conditions are met.

Letter rogatory

See commission rogatoire.

Memorandum of understanding (MOU)

Agreement between two parties establishing a set of principles that

govern their relationship on a particular matter. An MOU is often used by

countries to govern their sharing of assets in international asset-

forfeiture cases or to set out their respective duties in anti-money

laundering initiatives. Financial intelligence units (FIUs), with the task of

receiving and analyzing suspicious transaction reports on an ongoing

basis and maintaining close links with police and customs authorities,

share information among themselves informally in the context of

investigations, usually on the basis of an MOU.

Monetary instruments

Traveler’s checks, negotiable instruments, including personal checks

and business checks, official bank checks, cashier’s checks, promissory

notes, money orders, securities or stocks in bearer form. Monetary

instruments are normally included, along with currency, in the

antimoney laundering regulations of most countries, and financial

institutions must file reports and maintain records of customer activities

involving them.

Money laundering

The process of concealing or disguising the existence, source,

movement, destination or illegal application of illicitly derived property

or funds to make them appear legitimate. It usually involves a three-part

system: placement of funds into a financial system, layering of

transactions to disguise the source, ownership and location of the funds

and integration of the funds into society in the form of holdings that

appear legitimate. The definition of money laundering varies in each

country where it is recognized as a crime.

Money laundering reporting officer (MLRO)

A term used in various international rules to refer to the person

responsible for overseeing a firm’s anti-money laundering activities and

program and for filing reports of suspicious transactions with the

national FIU. The MLRO is the key person in the implementation of anti-

money laundering strategies and policies.

Money order

A monetary instrument usually purchased with cash in small (generally

under 500 euros) denominations. It is commonly used by people

without checking accounts to pay bills or to pay for purchases in which

the vendor will not accept a personal check. Money orders may be

used for laundering because they represent an instrument drawn on

the issuing institution rather than on an individual’s account.

Money services business (MSB)

A person (whether a natural or legal person) engaged in any of the

following activities where it exceeds the applicable regulatory

threshold, at which point the person is generally deemed to be a

financial institution subject to AML obligations.

•  Dealing in foreign exchange

•  Check cashing

•

Issuing or selling traveler’s checks or money orders

•  Providing or selling prepaid access

•  Money transmission

Money transfer service or value transfer service

Financial service that accepts cash, checks and other monetary

instruments that can store value in one location and pay a

corresponding sum in cash or other form to a beneficiary in another

location by means of a communication, message, transfer or through a

clearing network to which the money/value transfer service belongs.

Transactions performed by such services can involve one or more

intermediaries and a third-party final payment. A money or value

transfer service may be provided by people (natural or legal) formally

through the regulated financial system (e.g., bank accounts), informally

through nonbank financial institutions and business entities or outside of

the regulated system. In some jurisdictions, informal systems are

referred to as alternative remittance services or underground (or

parallel) banking systems.

MONEYVAL

Council of Europe Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of

Anti-Money Laundering Measures. Formerly PC-R-EV, the committee

was established in 1997 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of

Europe to conduct self and mutual assessments of anti-money

laundering measures in place in Council of Europe countries that are

not FATF members. MONEYVAL is a sub-committee of the European

Committee on Crime Problems of the Council of Europe (CDPC).

Monitoring

An element of an institution’s anti-money laundering program in which

customer activity is reviewed for unusual or suspicious patterns, trends

or outlying transactions that do not fit a normal pattern. Transactions

are often monitored using software that weighs the activity against a

threshold of what is deemed normal and expected for the customer.

Mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT)

Agreement among countries allowing for mutual assistance in legal

proceedings and access to documents and witnesses and other legal

and judicial resources in the respective countries, in private and public

sectors, for use in official investigations and prosecutions.

Nesting

The practice where a respondent bank provides downstream

correspondent services to other financial institutions and processes

these transactions through its own correspondent account. The

correspondent bank is thus processing transactions for financial

institutions on which it has not conducted due diligence. Although this is

a normal part of correspondent banking, it requires the correspondent

bank to conduct enhanced due diligence on its respondent’s AML

program to adequately mitigate the risk of processing the customer’s

customers’ transactions.

Nongovernmental organization (NGO)

Nonprofit organizations that are not directly linked to the governments

of specific countries, and perform a variety of service and humanitarian

functions, including bringing citizen concerns to governments,

advocating for causes and encouraging political participation. Some

countries’ antimoney laundering regulations for NGOs still have

loopholes that some worry could be exploited by terrorists or terrorist

sympathizers trying to secretly move money.

Nonprofit organizations (NPO)

These can take on a variety of forms, depending on the jurisdiction and

legal system, including associations, foundations, fund-raising

committees, community service organizations, corporations of public

interest, limited companies and public benevolent institutions. FATF has

suggested practices to help authorities protect organizations that raise

or disburse funds for charitable, religious, cultural, educational, social or

fraternal purposes from being misused or exploited by financiers of

terrorism.

Offshore

Literally, away from one’s own home country—if one lives in Europe, the

United States is offshore. In the money laundering lexicon, the term

refers to jurisdictions deemed favorable to foreign investments

because of low or no taxation or strict bank secrecy regulations.

Offshore banking license

A license that prohibits a bank from doing business with local citizens or

in local currency as a condition of its license.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

Offshore financial center (OFC)

Institutions that cater to or otherwise encourage banks, trading

companies and other corporate or legal entities to physically or legally

exist in a jurisdiction but limit their operations to offshore, meaning

outside the jurisdiction (see offshore). OFCs have historically been

located in the Caribbean or on Mediterranean islands to be in

reasonable proximity to the major financial centers of the U.S. and

Europe.

Omnibus account

See clearing account.

Operational risk

The risk of direct or indirect loss of operations due to inadequate or

failed internal processes, people or systems, or as a result of external

events. Public perception that a bank is not able to manage its

operational risk effectively can disrupt or harm the business of the bank.

Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)

International organization that assists governments on economic

development issues in the global economy. OECD houses the FATF

Secretariat in Paris.

Originator

The account holder or, where there is no account, the person (natural

or legal) that places the order with the financial institution to perform

the wire transfer.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Page 414

Version 6.44

Payable through account

Transaction account opened at a depository institution by a foreign

financial institution through which the foreign institution’s customers

engage, either directly or through subaccounts, in banking activities

and transactions in such a manner that the financial institution’s

customers have direct control over the funds in the account. These

accounts pose risks to the depository institutions that hold them

because it can be difficult to conduct due diligence on foreign

institution customers who are ultimately using the PTA accounts.

Physical presence

Existence of an actual brick-and-mortar location with meaningful

management of the institution physically located within a country,

where it maintains business records and is subject to supervision. The

mere existence of a local agent or low level staff does not constitute

physical presence.

Placement

The first phase of the money laundering process: The physical disposal

of proceeds derived from illegal activity.

Politically exposed person (PEP)

According to FATF’s revised 40 Recommendations of 2012, a PEP is an

individual who has been entrusted with prominent public functions in a

foreign country, such as a head of state, senior politician, senior

government official, judicial or military official, senior executive of a

state-owned corporation or important political party official, as well as

their families and close associates. The term PEP does not extend to

middle-ranking individuals in the specified categories. Various country

regulations will define the term PEP, which may include domestic as

well as foreign persons.

Ponzi scheme

A money laundering system named after Charles Ponzi, an Italian

immigrant who spent 10 years in jail in the U.S. for a scheme that

defrauded 40,000 people out of $15 million. Ponzi’s name became

synonymous with the use of new investors’ money to pay off prior

investors. Ponzi schemes involve fake, nonexistent investment

schemes in which the investors are tricked into investing on the

promise of unusually attractive returns. The operator of the scheme

can keep the operation going by paying off early investors with the

money from new investors until the scheme collapses under its own

weight and/or the promoter vanishes with the remaining money.

Predicate crimes

Specified unlawful activities whose proceeds, if involved in the subject

transaction, can give rise to prosecution for money laundering. Most

anti-money laundering laws contain a wide definition or listing of such

underlying crimes. Predicate crimes are sometimes defined as felonies

or “all offenses in the criminal code.”

Private banking

A department in a financial institution that provides high-end services

to wealthy individuals. Private banking transactions tend to be marked

with confidentiality, complex beneficial ownership arrangements,

offshore investment vehicles, tax shelters and credit extension services.

Private investment company (PIC)

Also known as a personal investment company, a PIC is a type of

corporation that is often established in an offshore jurisdiction with tight

secrecy laws to protect the privacy of its owners. In some jurisdictions,

an international business company or exempt company is referred to

as a private investment company.

Pyramid scheme

Version 6.44

Red flag

A warning signal that should bring attention to a potentially suspicious

situation, transaction or activity.

Regulatory agency

A government entity responsible for supervising and overseeing one or

more categories of financial institutions. The agency generally has

authority to issue regulations, to conduct examinations, to impose fines

and penalties, to curtail activities and, sometimes, to terminate charters

of institutions under its jurisdiction. Most financial regulatory agencies

play a major role in preventing and detecting money laundering and

other financial crimes. Most regulators focus on domestic institutions,

but some have the ability to regulate foreign branches and operations

of institutions.

Remittance services

Also referred to as giro houses or casas de cambio, remittance services

are businesses that receive cash or other funds that they transfer

through the banking system to another account. The account is held by

an associated company in a foreign jurisdiction where the money is

made available to the ultimate recipient.

Reputational risk

The potential that adverse publicity regarding a financial institution’s

business practices and associations, whether accurate or not, will cause

a loss of confidence in the integrity of the institution. Banks and other

financial institutions are especially vulnerable to reputational risk

because they can become a vehicle for, or a victim of, illegal activities

perpetrated by customers. Such institutions may protect themselves

through know-your-customer and know-your-employee programs.

Respondent bank

A bank for which another financial institution establishes, maintains,

administers or manages a correspondent account.

Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist

Version 6.44

Risk-based approach

The assessment of the varying risks associated with different types of

businesses, clients, accounts and transactions in order to maximize the

effectiveness of an anti-money laundering program.

Safe harbor

Legal protection for financial institutions, their directors, officers and

employees from criminal and civil liability for breach of any restriction

on disclosing information imposed by contract or by any legislative,

regulatory or administrative prohibition, if they report their suspicions in

good faith to the financial investigation unit (FIU), even if they did not

know precisely what the underlying criminal activity was, and regardless

of whether illegal activity actually occurred.

Seize

To prohibit the transfer, conversion, disposition or movement of funds

or other assets on the basis of an action initiated by a competent

authority or a court under a freezing mechanism. However, unlike a

freeze, a seizure allows the competent authority to take control of

specified funds or other assets. The seized assets remain the property

of the individual(s) or entity(ies) that held an interest in them at the time

of the seizure, although the competent authority will often take over

possession, administration or management of the seized assets.

Senior foreign political figure

U.S. term for foreign politically exposed persons. See politically exposed

persons.

Settlors

People or companies who transfer ownership of their assets to trustees

by means of a trust deed. Where the trustees have some discretion as

to the investment and distribution of the trust’s assets, the deed may be

accompanied by a non-legally binding letter setting out what the settlor

wishes done with the assets.

Shell bank

Bank that exists on paper only and that has no physical presence in the

country where it is incorporated or licensed, and which is unaffiliated

with a regulated financial services group that is subject to effective

consolidated supervision.

Smurfing

A commonly used money laundering method, smurfing involves the

use of multiple individuals and/or multiple transactions for making cash

deposits, buying monetary instruments or bank drafts in amounts under

the reporting threshold. The individuals hired to conduct the

transactions are referred to as smurfs. See structuring.

Sting operation

Investigative tactic in which undercover officers pose as criminals,

sometimes through a front business, to win the confidence of

suspected or known criminals to gather information and to obtain

evidence of criminal conduct. It is an effective means of identifying

criminals, penetrating criminal organizations and identifying tainted

property in money laundering and other cases.

Structuring

Illegal act of splitting cash deposits or withdrawals into smaller amounts,

or purchasing monetary instruments, to stay under a currency

reporting threshold. The practice might involve dividing a sum of

money into lesser quantities and making two or more deposits or

withdrawals that add up to the original amount. Money launderers use

structuring to avoid triggering a filing by a financial institution. The

technique is common in jurisdictions that have compulsory currency

reporting requirements. See smurfing.

Version 6.44

Subpoena

Compulsory legal process issued by a court to compel the appearance

of a witness at a judicial proceeding, sometimes requiring the witness

to bring specified documents. The term can refer to either the process

or the actual document that compels the recipient to act.

Suspicious activity

Irregular or questionable customer behavior or activity that may be

related to a money laundering or other criminal offense, or to the

financing of a terrorist activity. May also refer to a transaction that is

inconsistent with a customer’s known legitimate business, personal

activities or the normal level of activity for that kind of business or

account.

Suspicious activity report (SAR)

A government filing required by reporting entities that includes a

financial institution’s account of a questionable transaction. Many

jurisdictions require financial institutions to report suspicious

transactions to relevant government authorities such as its FIU on a

suspicious activity report (SAR).

Suspicious transaction report (STR)

See suspicious activity report.

Tax haven

Countries that offer special tax incentives or tax avoidance to foreign

investors and depositors.

Terrorist financing

The process by which terrorists fund their operations in order to

perform terrorist acts. There are two primary sources of financing for

terrorist activities. The first involves financial support from countries,

organizations or individuals. The other involves a wide variety of

revenue-generating activities, some illicit, including smuggling and

credit card fraud.

Testimony

Witness’ oral presentation, usually under oath, that describes facts

known to the witness.

Tipping off

Improper or illegal act of notifying a suspect that he or she is the

subject of a suspicious transaction report or is otherwise being

investigated or pursued by the authorities.

Trade finance

See letter of credit.

Transparency International (TI)

Berlin-based, nongovernmental organization dedicated to increasing

government accountability and curbing both international and national

corruption. Established in 1993, TI is active in approximately 100

countries. It publishes corruption news on its website daily and offers an

archive of corruption-related news articles and reports. Its Corruption

Online Research and Information System, or CORIS, is perhaps the

most comprehensive worldwide database on corruption. TI is best

known for its annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which ranks

countries by perceived levels of corruption among public officials; its

Bribe Payers Index (BPI) ranks the leading exporting countries

according to their propensity to bribe. TI’s annual Global Corruption

Report combines the CPI and the BPI and ranks each country by its

overall level of corruption. The lists help financial institutions determine

the risk associated with a particular jurisdiction.

Trust

Arrangement among the property owner (the grantor), a beneficiary

and a manager of the property (the trustee), whereby the trustee

manages the property for the benefit of the beneficiary in accordance

with terms set by the grantor.

Trustee

May be a paid professional or company or unpaid person that holds the

assets in a trust fund separate from the trustee’s own assets. The

trustee invests and disposes of the assets in accordance with the

settlor’s trust deed, taking into consideration any letter of wishes.

Typology

Refers to a money laundering method and is a term used by FATF.

Adopted in 2001, the resolution requires member nations to take a

series of actions to combat terrorism through the adoption of laws and

regulations and the establishment of administrative structures. The

resolution also requires member nations to “afford one another the

greatest measure of assistance for criminal investigations or criminal

proceedings relating to the financing or support of terrorist acts.”

United Nations (U.N.)

An international organization that was established in 1945 by 51

countries committed to preserving peace through cooperation and

collective security. Today, nearly every nation in the world belongs to

the U.N. See also Vienna Convention. The United Nations contributes to

the fight against organized crime with initiatives such as the Global

Program against Money Laundering (GPML), the key instrument of the

U.N. Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention in this task. Through

the GPML, the U.N. helps member states to introduce legislation against

money laundering and to develop mechanisms to combat this crime.

The program encourages anti-money laundering policy development,

monitors and analyzes the problems and responses, raises public

awareness about money laundering and acts as a coordinator of joint

anti-money laundering initiatives with other international organizations.

Unusual transaction

Transaction that appears designed to circumvent reporting

requirements, is inconsistent with the account’s transaction patterns or

deviates from the activity expected for that type of account.

USA PATRIOT Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools

Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Public Law

107-56). Enacted on October 26, 2001, the historic U.S. law brought

about momentous changes in the anti-money laundering field,

including more than 50 amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act. Title III of

the Act, the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-

Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, contains most, but not all, of its anti-

money laundering-related provisions.

Value transfer service

See money transfer service.

Vienna Convention

Convention in 1988 against the Illicit Trade in Narcotic Drugs and

Psychotropic Substances. Countries that become parties to the Vienna

Convention commit to criminalizing drug trafficking and associated

money laundering, and enacting measures for the confiscation of the

proceeds of drug trafficking. Article III of the Convention provides a

comprehensive definition of money laundering, which has been the

basis of much subsequent national legislation.

Virtual currency

A medium of exchange that operates in the digital space that can

typically be converted into either a fiat (e.g., government-issued

currency) or it can be a substitute for real currency.

Willful blindness

Legal principle that operates in money laundering cases in the U.S. and

is defined by courts as the “deliberate avoidance of knowledge of the

facts” or “purposeful indifference.” Courts have held that willful

blindness is the equivalent of actual knowledge of the illegal source of

funds or of the intentions of a customer in a money laundering

transaction.

Wolfsberg Group

Named after the castle in Switzerland where its first working session

was held, the Wolfsberg Group is an association of global financial

institutions, including Banco Santander, Bank of America, Bank of

Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group,

Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, J.P. Morgan Chase, Société

Générale, Standard Chartered Bank and UBS. In 2000, along with

Transparency International and experts worldwide, the institutions

developed global anti-money laundering guidelines for international

private banks. Since then, it has issued several other guidelines on

correspondent banking and terrorist financing, among others.

World Bank

The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to

developing countries. It is not a bank in the usual sense, but is made up

of two unique development institutions owned by 184 member

countries—the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development

(IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). Both

organizations provide low-interest loans, interest-free credit and grants

to developing countries. In 2002, the IMF and the World Bank launched a

12-month pilot program to assess countries’ anti-money laundering and

counter-terrorist financing measures. The World Bank and the IMF, in

conjunction with FATF, developed a common methodology to conduct

such assessments based on the FATF’s 40 Recommendations.
