ACFCS
AND
THE
CHALLENGE
OF FINANCIAL
CRIME

THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FINANCIAL
CRIME SPECIALISTS

The Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists (ACFCS)

was  created  to  respond  to  the  growing  need  for  documented,

verifiable  and  certifiable  knowledge  and  skill  in  the  financial

crime  field  and  to  meet  the  career  development  needs  of  the

diverse  and  growing  number  of  specialists  in  the  private  and

public sectors who work in this field.

11

CHAPTER 1 • ACFCS AND THE CHALLENGE OF FINANCIAL CRIME

To  build  the  certification  examination,  ACFCS
took  various  steps  over  several  months.  Initially,
a group of diverse, expert professionals gathered
over several days to identify hundreds of job tasks
that are performed by financial crime specialists
in distinct occupations.

Once they identified the job tasks, their work was
distilled  and  framed  into  hundreds  of  questions
that  went  into  a  worldwide  survey,  asking  spe-
cialists  of  many  occupations  and  in  many  world
regions to evaluate the job tasks for importance,
gravity, frequency and other factors. The ACFCS
worldwide survey was also designed to determine
the skills, competencies and job tasks that should
be considered essential to test a candidate for the
Certified Financial Crime Specialist certification.

Nearly  400  specialists  throughout  the  world
responded  to  the  survey  and  provided  the  data
that  is  the  foundation  of  the  certification  exam.
The  survey  was  designed  by  volunteer  expert
professionals  and  ACFCS  under  the  guidance  of
psychometric  experts  from  a  distinguished  psy-
chometric testing firm. The survey identified that
financial crime professionals need knowledge and
skills in the topics listed below, which are also the
topics tested on the exam:

•  Financial Crime Elements and Overview

•  Money Laundering

•  Corruption Enforcement and Investigation

•  Money and Commodities Flows

•  Tax Evasion and Enforcement

•  Fraud Detection and Prevention

•  Investigations

•  Cybersecurity and Privacy

•  Sanctions Compliance

•  Ethics

•  Compliance Programs and Controls

•  International Standards

•  Asset Recovery

The  principal  mission  of  ACFCS  is  to  certify  the
skill, knowledge and expertise of financial crime
specialists  across  the  full  spectrum  of  financial
crime.  It  provides  learning  and  continuing  edu-
cation  benefits  that  help  financial  crime  special-
ists  advance  and  elevate  their  careers.  ACFCS  is
also  committed  to  providing  its  members  and
the  larger  global  audience  with  a  community  of
live  and  virtual  networking  opportunities  that
allow  them  to  connect  with  other  profession-
als worldwide.

To  achieve  these  goals,  ACFCS  counts  on  a  pro-
fessional staff that has decades of experience in
managing  highly  regarded  professional  associa-
tions.  ACFCS  is  guided  by  a  distinguished  Advi-
sory Board that is composed of top international
experts in diverse fields. They guide the associa-
tion and  provide direction and  assistance  in  the
development of its programs and services.

ACFCS CERTIFICATION EXAMINATION
The CFCS certification examination is a universal
exam. It does not rely on the knowledge of laws
or regulation of any one country or region for the
basis of the examination. It is also unitary, mean-
ing that it is not designed for any specific number
of occupations or professions. Instead, it is built
to accommodate the job tasks and requirements
of all occupations in the financial crime field.

CHAPTER 1 • ACFCS AND THE CHALLENGE OF FINANCIAL CRIME

This  Certification  Examination  Preparation  Man-
ual  is  designed  to  provide  you  with  instruction
that  will  prepare  you  for  the  examination.  By
studying  this  manual,  however,  you  should  not
assume you will earn a passing grade on the exam.
Other knowledge and experience in diverse finan-
cial crime fields in the private/public sectors will
enhance  your  preparedness.  This  manual  also
includes practice questions similar to those in the
actual exam and an extensive listing of references
you may wish to review for further preparation.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE CFCS
CERTIFICATION EXAM
The CFCS certification examination is constructed
according  to  the  same  nationally  recognized  psy-
chometric  standards  as  other  distinguished  pro-
fessional  certifications.  To  meet  the  most  exact-
ing  standards,  top  financial  crime,  psychometric
and certification experts have devoted more than
one thousand hours, and hundreds of respondents
shared their answers and comments in the exten-
sive worldwide survey that ACFCS conducted.

This  process  was  overseen  by  a  professional
staff  with  substantial  experience  in  creating  and
administering  professional  certifications.  ACFCS
adheres to the principles of psychometric compe-
tency  assessment  to  ensure  that  its  certification
exam is a fair, unambiguous legally defensible test
of knowledge and skill.

In collaboration with ACFCS, a psychometric firm
assures  security  at  hundreds  of  testing  locations
worldwide, including more than 400 in the United
States  and  Canada.  Candidates  for  the  CFCS  cer-
tification  who  meet  the  application  requirements
may take the proctored exam at any of these loca-
tions  by  appointment.  Also,  ACFCS  offers  online
proctored exams for those who are not close to a
testing center.

ACFCS is independent of all government agencies,
vendors, attorneys and consultants.

CHAPTER 1 • ACFCS AND THE CHALLENGE OF FINANCIAL CRIME

CONCLUSION
The  effort  against  financial  crime  in  the  private
and public sectors faces growing challenges. The
skills  and  knowledge  that  professionals  like  you
must  acquire,  refine  and  display  to  meet  these
challenges have great value. We challenge you to
become a CFCS and stand on the cutting edge of
financial crime competence.

With thoughtful attention to the material in this
Manual,  you  will  go  far  toward  success  in  the
CFCS certification exam. Your work as a Certified
Financial  Crime  Specialist  can  offer  enormous
benefits to your employer and organization, your
clients  and  your  career.  From  the  entire  ACFCS
team, we wish you the best.

JOB AND CAREER BENEFITS FROM
CFCS CERTIFICATION
By  earning  the  CFCS  certification,  a  person  will
validate  his  or  her  skills  and  earn  an  objective,
verifiable  credential  of  competence.  The  CFCS
certification  will  enable  financial  crime  spe-
cialists  to  advance  their  careers  and  give  them
compelling evidence of an advanced level of pro-
fessional  skill.  It  will  assure  employers  that  the
work  of  discharging  or  managing  organizational
responsibilities,  advocating  for  their  interests
and strategically promoting their cause is in the
hands  of  someone  who  meets  independent,  rig-
orous  standards  of  knowledge  and  skill  in  the
financial crime field.

The  CFCS  certification  provides  a  unique,  mar-
ketable  asset  in  a  competitive  workforce.  It
demonstrates  talent  and  skill.  Those  who  earn
it  can  expect  to  be  compensated  accordingly.
Increasingly,  organizations  in  the  private  and
public  sectors  around  the  world  are  certifying
their  personnel  as  a  visible  sign  of  commitment
to competence and skill. The CFCS certification is
a timely embodiment of the “knowledge economy”
or “knowledge era” in which we now live.

With thoughtful attention to the
material in this Manual, you will
go far toward success in the CFCS
certiﬁcation exam.

CHAPTER 2

FINANCIAL
CRIME
OVERVIEW,
COMMONALITIES
 AND
CONVERGENCE

FINANCIAL CRIME OVERVIEW

The  world  is  awash  in  financial  crime.  No  person  or  organiza-

tion, public or private, secular or religious, profit or nonprofit is

immune.  Perpetrators  of  financial  crime  come  in  many  forms,

often using the façade of sham or shell legal entities to conduct

their criminal activity.

The  immense  earnings  of  financial  criminals  and  their  global

co-conspirators are impossible to calculate but easily run into

the trillions of dollars annually. Notable examples of the sources

of illicit profits of financial criminals are the public and private

healthcare programs that many nations provide to their citizens.

The  United  States  government,  for  example,  claims  its  Medi-

care program suffers fraud losses of about $70 billion annually,

or the equivalent of $192 million daily. Just as with other finan-

cial  crimes,  the  fallout  goes  beyond  the  healthcare  programs

themselves. Higher taxes and insurance premiums, along with

increased government expenses to monitor and supervise the

integrity of the programs, are some of the consequences.

15

CHAPTER 2 • FINANCIAL CRIME  OVERVIEW,  COMMONALITIES  AND  CONVERGENCE

Much of this fraud, and thousands of other similar
instances worldwide, is facilitated by corruption
of the participants in the programs or in the pub-
lic agencies that conduct them. Lax controls and
auditing,  poor  supervision  by  regulators,  inade-
quate enforcement by investigative agencies and
inattention  to  recovering  the  assets  stolen  by
financial criminals emboldens others and breeds
more financial crime.

This  Manual  covers  all  of  them,  focusing  mainly
on  crimes  that  have  a  cash  or  economic  advan-
tage  as  their  primary  objective.  However,  the
Manual does not deal with some profit-motivated
crimes,  such  as  drug  trafficking,  illegal  gam-
bling, nuclear trafficking, prostitution and similar
offenses.  While  these  crimes  are  also  motivated
by the desire to make money, they do not fit into
the financial crime categories in this Manual.

Government agencies and private sector victims
of  financial  crime  fare  poorly  in  recovering  the
funds  that  are  taken  unlawfully  from  govern-
ment  programs  and  from  private  sector  victims.
While estimates are inherently difficult, statistics
issued by government agencies suggest that only
2  to  5  percent  of  assets  that  private-  and  pub-
lic-sector  victims  lose  to  financial  criminals  is
ever recovered. Asset recovery is addressed in its
own chapter of this Manual.

DEFINING FINANCIAL CRIME AND ITS
PERMUTATIONS
Permutations and perpetrators of financial crime
constantly evolve. At any given moment, persons
in all parts of the world are conceiving new ways
to  take  money  or  gain  economic  advantage  ille-
gally from organizational and individual victims.

Except for crimes of passion and those committed
to make an ideological statement, such as terror-
ism, all crimes are committed to make money or
gain an economic advantage. Even crimes of pure
passion sometimes have a financial element, such
as in the case of a person plotting the murder of
a family member to claim a life insurance policy.

Most financial crimes have four phases:

1.  When the crime is being planned

2.  When the crime is committed

3.  When the proceeds are laundered

4.  When the victim’s losses are identified and

asset recovery is needed.

For  your  needs,  we  will  cover  those  crimes  in
which  perpetrators  possess  or  control  the  crim-
inal  proceeds.  At  that  point,  these  criminals
become  classic  financial  criminals  who  must
engage  in  some  of  the  common  steps  that  all
financial  criminals  take.  Money  laundering  is
present  in  all  financial  crimes  and  is  a  common
and  essential  element  that  all  financial  crimes
share, regardless of how they made their money.

What  is  financial  crime?  A  good  working  defini-
tion  may  be  that  it  is  a  non-violent  action  that
results in the unlawful taking, moving, hiding or
disguising of money or other value by the use of
guile,  artifice,  corruption  or  deception  for  the
benefit of the perpetrator or of another.

Financial crimes include corruption, money laun-
dering,  fraud,  tax  evasion  and  sanctions  viola-
tions.  Each  of  these  categories  has  subsets,  off-
shoots or tributaries. For example, identity theft
and embezzlement are subsets of fraud. Corrup-
tion exists in both the public and private sectors.
Money  laundering  may  be  practiced  in  many
ways and may involve persons in all walks of life
and private and public-sector organizations. One
type of financial crime often overlaps another, as
is discussed below in the section dealing with the
commonalities of financial crime.

theft, for example, is not a new type of crime, but
the advance of technology has spurred its growth
and  made  it  a  global  menace.  Similarly,  cyber-
crime  did  not  exist  before  the  arrival  of  digital
technology and the Internet.

Financial crime today is more extensive, complex
and  technology-driven  than  ever  before;  so  are
the government and private sector efforts against
it. Investigative and enforcement procedures and
regulatory measures that seek to block or detect
financial  crime  need  to  grow  at  the  pace  of  the
evolving techniques of financial criminals.

New  laws  and  regulations,  multinational  agree-
ments,  treaties  and  conventions,  and  working
groups are all aimed at financial crime. Non-gov-
ernmental  organizations,  such  as  the  Financial
Action  Task  Force  (FATF),  the  Egmont  Group,
Interpol and others, have been formed in the past
fifty years to help public and private sector orga-
nizations to combat financial crime.

Starting  in  1990  with  the  creation  of  the  US
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),
nations  began  creating  agencies  that  have  come
to be known as Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs)
that  facilitate  international  information  sharing
and  cooperation.  The  success  of  these  efforts
often  depends  on  the  political  will  of  nations  to
accept, adopt and enforce them.

The  patchwork  of  national  and  international
requirements  and  standards  places  the  duty  to
monitor, investigate, report, train and remediate

on  financial  institutions,  businesses,  and  other
organizations, all at a significant cost.

Even  in  the  face  of  these  mighty  defensive  and
offensive  efforts  composed  of  private-  and  pub-
lic-sector  organizations,  financial  crime  contin-
ues  to  grow.  Financial  criminals  are  industrious
and  find  weaknesses,  loopholes,  negligence  or
corruption to facilitate their crimes.

GLOBALIZATION OF
FINANCIAL CRIME
it  crosses
Financial  crime  flourishes  when
national  borders.  By  crossing  these  borders,  the
financial  criminal  complicates  law  enforcement
efforts by forcing the agencies of one country to
obtain  the  cooperation  of  their  counterparts  in
other countries for the purpose of gathering evi-
dence or locating suspects and witnesses. It usu-
ally causes the pertinent authorities to seek the
assistance of an international treaty, convention
or  agreement,  or  an  international  organization
such as Interpol.

This takes extra time, which favors the financial
criminal. As time passes, the financial criminal is
better able to find refuge for the financial crime
proceeds,  tamper  with  the  evidence  and  even
seek safe haven.

The  more  than  60  “secrecy  havens”  around  the
globe,  ranging  from  obscure  islands,  such  as
Nauru and Tortola, to long-standing havens, such
as  Lichtenstein  and  Switzerland,  are  a  conve-
nient and vital resource for financial criminals to
move and hide their assets. These havens provide
financial  criminals  a  crucial  resource  that  com-
pletes the crime.

COMMONALITIES OF ALL

money  laundering,  fraud  and  corruption,  each

threat  finance,  identity  theft  and  commercial
bribery. But, they all share several constant com-
monalities, which make them more alike than not.

Recognizing  and  exploiting  the  commonalities
helps  private-  and  public-sector  organizations
build  a  cohesive,  comprehensive  and  collabora-
tive  approach  to  financial  crime,  and  maybe  get
even  better  results.  The  issue  of  convergence  is
discussed in this chapter.

Financial crimes have these commonalities:
All  financial  crimes  involve  money  laundering.
At  some  point  in  the  planning  and  execution  of
financial crimes, all of them involve money laun-
dering.  A  business  involved  in  a  foreign  corrupt
payment, a public official who receives illicit pay-
ments,  a  violator  of  sanctions  laws,  an  identity

thief and other financial criminals, at some point,
must hide or disguise the criminal proceeds. The
domestic  or  international  movement  of  “clean”
money for the purpose of committing a financial
crime, money laundering is a necessary function
of the financial criminal because it permits him to
mask his involvement in the financial crime, evade
the  payment  of  taxes  and  move  the  money  to
hide it from victims and government authorities.
The broad reach of most money laundering laws
and  the  predicate  crimes  that  activate  prosecu-
tions  for  money  laundering,  as  well  as  the  inter-
national  money  laundering  control  standards  of
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and other
world bodies, lend credibility to the fact that all
financial crimes involve money laundering.

CHAPTER 2 • FINANCIAL CRIME  OVERVIEW,  COMMONALITIES  AND  CONVERGENCE

All  financial  crimes  result  in  tax  evasion.  It
would be a unique financial criminal who would
go to great lengths of stealing and disguising his
gains and still declare his criminal proceeds in an
income  tax  return.  Tax  evasion  is  committed  by
the parties on both sides of most financial crime
transactions, such as those involving corruption.
Where  a  transaction  involves  official  corruption,
for example, tax evasion is usually committed by
both  parties  of  the  transaction.  The  corrupter
falsifies  his  tax  return  by  mischaracterizing  the
withdrawal  or  transmission  of  funds  or  the  gen-
eration  of  cash  destined  for  the  corrupt  official.
The public official who receives the corrupt pay-
ment will either not report the income or falsify
its source on the tax returns that he may file.

Tax evasion is not only a financial crime in its own
right,  but  it  is  also  a  byproduct  of  other  crimes.
The FATF announced in February 2012 that it was
expanding  its  “40  Recommendations”  on  money
laundering  after  22  years  to  include  recommen-
dation for measures against tax evasion. This can
be  viewed  as  an  important  validation  that  finan-
cial crime and tax evasion are intertwined.

Apart  from  this  important  step  toward  a  more
active world effort against tax evasion, the enact-
ment of far-reaching tax compliance laws with a
multinational reach, like the landmark US Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) of 2010, is a
harbinger  of  a  more  active  multinational  assault
on  tax  evasion  and  its  arrival  as  a  top  interna-
tional  priority.  These  landmark  developments,
symbolized  by  FATCA  and  the  OECD’s  Common
Reporting  Standard,  are  among  the  major  finan-
cial crime developments of the early part of the
21st  century.  They  are  discussed  in  the  chapter
on tax evasion.

All  financial  crimes  require  a  financial  institu-
tion. No financial crime of any magnitude can be
carried  out  without  a  financial  institution.  The
term  “financial  institution”  covers  more  than
banks. In the broad sense, it also includes private
banks,  credit  unions,  cooperative  institutions,

FATCA Report

securities  dealers,  insurance  companies,  com-
modities  traders,  money  transmitters  and  other
entities  where  the  public  can  conduct  financial
transactions.

The FATF resources offer a wealth of information
on  financial  crime,  including  the  wide  range  of
financial institutions that financial criminals use.
The FATF also publishes a wide range of financial
crime  typologies  and  commentaries  that  finan-
cial crime specialists will find helpful. The many
types of financial institutions and businesses that
are  implicated  in  financial  crime  cases  attest  to
the  indispensability  of  financial  institutions  to
financial criminals and the diversity of them.

The  vulnerability  of  these  businesses  to  be  lev-
eraged  in  a  financial  crime  is  compounded  by
the  risks  that  their  employees,  who  may  be  cor-
rupted or compromised, present. All institutions
and  businesses  face  this  common  threat  of  the
“enemy within.” These are the employees or insid-
ers that can compromise operations, steal or leak
confidential  information,  corrupt  internal  pro-
cesses,  rig  technological  settings  and  programs,
weaken  organizational  defenses,  assist  inside  or
outside financial criminals, and inflict harm that
their unique position enables them to carry out.

A corrupt or compromised employee can wreak as
much havoc or more in a private- or public-sector
organization as any outside financial criminal can.

CHAPTER 2 • FINANCIAL CRIME  OVERVIEW,  COMMONALITIES  AND  CONVERGENCE

The  irony  is  that  despite  this  ability  to  inflict  so
much harm, employees or insiders often receive
far less screening and due diligence examination
than customers before they are placed on the job.

Financial  institutions  spend  significant  time  and
money on due diligence reviews focused on cus-
tomers, but for employees or other insiders, they
spend relatively little in pre-employment screen-
ing and post- employment monitoring. Employees
are often hired with the prior review and approval
of only human resources departments. Investiga-
tion and vigilance of post-employment employee
and  insider  conduct  is  usually  the  responsibility
of corporate security departments.

Financial  criminals  appreciate  the  value  of  a
complicit  insider  and  are  eager  to  promote  the
employment of an accomplice by an organization
that they targeting.

All financial crimes interface with government
agencies. Every financial crime produces or acti-
vates a pre-existing interface for a financial insti-
tution  or  affected  business  with  a  government
agency.  For  most  financial  institutions,  a  regu-
latory  or  supervisory  agency  that  oversees  com-
pliance will normally need to be informed of the
occurrence or the suspicion of a financial crime
in  a  Suspicious  Activity  Report1  (SAR)  or  other
communication with an agency.

If  a  financial  crime  occurs  at  or  through  a  busi-
ness  that  is  not  required  to  file  suspicious  activ-
ity reports, the business will invariably interface
with a government agency when agents arrive to
investigate the crime or seek records pertaining
to the crime.

In  most  countries,  data  from  suspicious  activity
reports  and  other  government  reporting  forms
are  processed  through  government  “financial
intelligence  units.”  More  than  120  nations  have
FIUs,  which  band  together  in  a  confederation

1. These are known as Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) in many jurisdictions.

known  as  the  Egmont  Group.2  The  Group  facili-
tates the exchange of data and intelligence among
its  members,  under  security  protocols,  with  the
goal  of  improving  multinational  efforts  against
financial crime.

All  financial  crimes  create  the  need  for  asset
recovery.  All  financial  crime  leaves  someone
poorer  than  they  were  before.  The  major  recent
financial crimes, such as the Bernie Madoff Ponzi
scheme,  the  international  bank  mega-fraud  of
Allen  Stanford,  the  legal  settlements  scheme
of  Scott  Rothstein  and  others  have  left  behind
tens of thousands of victims with billions of dol-
lars in losses.

Thousands  of
less-celebrated  financial  crim-
inals  worldwide  leave  millions  of  other  vic-
tims  behind.  Victims  that  have  the  resources  to
attempt to recover their assets rarely succeed in
these efforts. Government agencies that seek to
recover  funds  that  are  stolen  from  government
programs are no more successful in their efforts,
despite the strong asset recovery, legal and judi-
cial weapons they possess.3

Asset  recovery  is  the  neglected  art  of  the  finan-
cial crime continuum. The failure to recover the
assets  taken  by  financial  criminals  is  a  primary
cause of the growth of financial crime. The deter-
rent  effect  that  successful  asset  recovery  could
achieve  is  missing.  Financial  criminals  have  the
pleasant  reality  that  they  rarely  are  required  to
relinquish the money they take from their victims
— even if they go to prison. Asset recovery is dis-
cussed extensively in a later chapter.

All (major) financial crimes involve more than one
country. Whether it is the location of the financial
crime victim, the base of operations of the finan-
cial criminal or his co-conspirators, the home of
the  financial  institutions  they  use,  or  the  coun-
tries where the criminal proceeds moved through
or were applied, all major financial crimes involve

multiple  countries,  especially  in  today’s  elec-
tronic world.

The  many  bilateral  agreements  and  multina-
tional  treaties,  mutual  legal  assistance  treaties,
tax  information  exchange  agreements,  financial
information  exchange  agreements,  inter-  gov-
ernmental  agreements,  extradition  treaties  and
other  international  cooperative  agreements  that
bear  on  financial  crime  underscore  the  interna-
tional nature of these crimes.

Some  laws  have  an  international  focus  by  defi-
nition  or  by  their  very  name.  The  US  Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is an example. The
placement  of  law  enforcement  agents  of  a  coun-
try  in  their  nation’s  embassies  overseas  and  the
work  of  international  organizations,  such  as
Interpol and the FATF, all highlight the cross-bor-
der nature of major financial crimes.

Financial  crime  often  involves  public  or  private
sector  corruption.  Nothing  facilitates  financial
crime more than a corrupt or complicit business
insider or public official. Corruption is the engine
that  drives  most  major  international  financial
crime. Appreciation of the corrosive effect of cor-
ruption has moved many organizations to mount
a  broad,  still  blossoming  assault  on  corrup-
tion in recent years, as evidenced in part by the
revised 40 Recommendations of the FATF. Global
anti-corruption  is  covered  in  its  own  chapter
of the Manual.

Public  and  private-sector  corruption  has  many
variations.  Examples  include  the  unlawful  pay-
ment  by  a  business  to  the  employee  of  another
business to obtain trade secrets, or the bribery of
a regulator to turn a blind eye to criminal activity
in a financial institution or other type of business.

of assets are recovered from financial crimes.

CHAPTER 2 • FINANCIAL CRIME  OVERVIEW,  COMMONALITIES  AND  CONVERGENCE

CAPITALIZING ON THE
‘COMMONALITIES’ AND EXPLORING
‘CONVERGENCE’
By  examining  these  commonalities,  financial
crime specialists in the distinct component fields
of  anti-money  laundering  (AML),  fraud,  global
anti-corruption  and  others  can  determine  if
adoption  of  a  coordinated,  integrated  approach,
instead of a splintered or siloed approach that now
characterizes financial crime efforts, is advisable.

Currently,  many  detection,  prevention,  regula-
tory  and  enforcement  efforts  directed  at  finan-
cial crime follow the siloed approach. A unified or
“converged” approach may allow private and pub-
lic  entities  to  end  underutilization  of  disciplines
and  allow  internal  units  to  achieve  greater  effi-
ciency, economies and effectiveness.

Understanding  and  appreciating  the  commonali-
ties can lead to development of a cohesive, more
effective  global  approach  to  financial  crime  in
public-  and  private-sector  entities.  The  culmi-
nation of this approach comes in the creation of
converged units with titles such as the Financial
Crime  Risk  Management  Group  within  institu-
tions  and  organizations.  This  approach  has  the
potential  to  improve  results,  streamline  proce-
dures,  upgrade  utility  of  information  and  intel-
ligence,  increase  collaboration  among  diverse
employees and organizations, and save money.

For example, some financial institutions have uni-
fied fraud and AML departments that previously
operated separately. This has allowed fraud inves-
tigators  to  learn  and  capitalize  on  monitoring
tools used by AML analysts and, at the same time,
provided the AML analysts access to the investi-
gative expertise of persons in the fraud units.

If the common bonds that financial crimes share
make  the  case  for  a  centralized  approach,  then
convergence  may  be  the  best  course  of  action.
The commonalities seem to justify a deep exam-
ination of the way financial crimes are dealt with
by  private-  and  public-sector  entities.  They  call
for  a  streamlined,  unified  effort  that  improves
effectiveness.

CONCLUSION
The  global  financial  crime  field  is  complex  and
rapidly  evolving,  but  recognizing  the  common-
alities  and  intersections  between  all  financial
crimes is a necessary starting point. Approaching
financial crime more holistically may offer a more
coordinated, efficient response in the compliance,
investigative and enforcement fields. It also serves
as a means to introduce the wide range of topics
that will be covered in subsequent chapters.

CHAPTER 3

  MONEY
LAUNDERING

OVERVIEW

For  financial  criminals,  money  laundering  is  an  indispensable,

ever-present element of all financial crimes. It can occur at the

beginning, middle or end of a crime, but it always happens. No

financial  crime,  such  as  fraud,  corruption,  tax  evasion,  viola-

tions  of  sanctions  laws  or  others,  may  be  committed  without

acts of money laundering at some stage in the offense.

23

Money laundering is a crime that has existed since
the  first  time  a  person  improperly  or  unlawfully
took something of value from someone else. Finan-
cial criminals know that the detection of their illicit
activity,  or  the  manner  by  which  the  proceeds  of
the  activity  are  derived,  moved  or  utilized,  will
unravel their scheme and usually lead to legal con-
sequences in most countries.

In effect, the detection of the movement of money
from the pockets of victims into the pockets of the
financial criminal is the most certain way to prove
the method and actors behind most financial crimes.

Money laundering, broadly defined, is the process
of  concealing  the  existence,  source  or  application
of income, or the disguising of its source to give it
the appearance of legitimacy. Efforts to detect and
prevent money laundering typically revolve around
understanding the source and origins of funds.

In  other  words,  money  laundering  is  the  act  of
deception in the control, management or movement
of money or other assets that have been derived by
illegal means, or that came from legitimate sources
but are being moved to another location to finance
or perpetrate an illegal act.

Although it has been practiced for millennia, money
laundering took a long time to obtain formal desig-
nation as a crime, and even longer for money laun-
dering laws to evolve into potent weapons against
financial and other profit-motivated crime.

In  1986,  the  United  States  was  the  first  nation  to
enact a law that classified money laundering, or the
“laundering  of  monetary  instruments,”  as  a  crime.
It  was  prompted  to  act,  largely,  by  the  realization
that  international  drug  trafficking  organizations
were earning billions of dollars and using financial
institutions and other legitimate businesses to hide,
move  and  disguise  their  massive  wealth.  At  the
same time, it recognized the negative effects of the
involvement  of  criminal  organizations  in  financial
institutions and other legitimate businesses as cus-

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

THE FINANCIAL
ACTION TASK FORCE
The  Financial  Action  Task  Force,  or  FATF,
was  formed  in  1989  by  the  world’s  largest
and  most  economically  powerful  nations,
the G-7 group of countries, which at the time
were Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
United Kingdom and United States. Since its
inception,  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force
has evolved into the principal standard-set-
ter  of  global  anti-money  laundering  norms
and  policies  adopted  by  nations,  financial
institutions and other organizations.

FATF was assigned to examine money laun-
dering  techniques  and  trends,  assess  the
policy  and  enforcement  action  already
undertaken  at  a  national  or  international
level,  and  set  out  measures  still  needed  to
combat money laundering. The first formal
action of the FATF in early 1990 was to pro-
mulgate  the  “40  Recommendations,”  a  set
of  recommended  conduct  for  government
agencies,  financial  institutions  and  other
organizations  in  combating  money  launder-
ing around the world.

In  2001,  the  development  of  standards  in
the  fight  against  terrorism  financing  was
added  to  the  mission  of  the  FATF.  In  Octo-
ber 2001, the FATF issued the Eight Special
Recommendations to deal with the issue of
terrorism  financing.  The  continued  evolu-
tion of money laundering techniques led the
FATF  to  revise  the  FATF  standards  compre-
hensively in June 2003. In February 2012, the
Recommendations  underwent  their  most
significant  revamping  in  almost  a  decade,
with  the  release  of  the  revised  40  Recom-
mendations that merged the Special Recom-
mendations back into the other standards.

tomers and owners, together with their corrupt-
ing influence in government operations.

Today,  nearly  every  country  has  enacted  money
laundering  laws  with  widely  varying  character-
istics. However, in general, they are all designed
to  serve  as  a  deterrent  to  financial  and  other
criminals  by  criminalizing  their  relationships
with  financial  institutions  and  other  legitimate
businesses, reducing their wealth and increasing
the  risk  for  financial  institutions  and  other  busi-
nesses that knowingly do business with them.

MONEY LAUNDERING METHODS
In  one  simple  example,  to  carry  out  a  Ponzi
scheme, the promoter must disguise the funds he
is  paying  to  the  initial  victims  of  the  scheme  as
their “investment earnings” when they truly rep-
resent funds received from later victims. That is
money laundering.

Another example is a scheme in which a company
draws funds from its account in its home country
and transports the funds across national borders
so  that  they  may  be  given,  through  an  interme-
diary or “bagman,” to a public official in another
country. The purpose of the illegal payment is to
influence the official acts of the public official. The
movement of those funds is money laundering.

An image of Charles Ponzi taken August 1920. That
year, Ponzi launched the investment fraud scheme
that would later come to bear his name.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

In a sanctions violation, a corporation that wants
to  continue  doing  business  with  a  sanctioned
country  routes  the  money  involved  in  a  prohib-
ited transaction through a third party that does
not  reside  in,  or  have  direct  relationships  with,
the  sanctioned  country.  That  is  money  laun-
dering as well.

In fact, any attempt or conduct designed to hide
and  conceal  the  source,  movement,  control  or
ownership  of  money  illegally  derived  is  an  act
of  money  laundering.  Similarly,  a  process  that
involves the movement of money derived through
legitimate  means,  but  which  is  intended  or  des-
tined  to  be  used  to  commit  a  crime,  such  as  in
the above example of the corrupt foreign official,
is also money laundering under the laws of many
nations, including the United States.

The  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF)  is  an
intergovernmental  organization  formed  in  1989
designed to establish global standards on money
laundering  controls.  It  is  based  in  Paris.  Long
ago,  the  FATF  developed  a  working  definition  of
money laundering involving funds that originated
in illegal activity:

1.  The conversion or transfer of property,
knowing that such property is derived
from a criminal offense, for the purpose of
concealing or disguising the illicit origin
of the property or of assisting any person
who is involved in the commission of such
an offense or offenses to evade the legal
consequences of his actions;

2.  The concealment or disguise of the true
nature, source, location, disposition,
movement, rights with respect to, or
ownership or property, knowing that such
property is derived from a criminal offense;

3.  The acquisition, possession or use of

property knowing at the time of receipt that
such property was derived from a criminal
offense or from an act of participation in
such offense.

retail stores

•  Exchanging cash for commodities and assets
such as precious metals, precious stones, or
high-value luxury goods

•  Changing currency into other financial

instruments like cashier’s or traveler’s checks

•  Utilizing “gatekeepers”, either complicit or

unwitting, like attorneys or wealth managers
to accept cash or move funds through
their accounts

•  Using complicit or corrupted financial

institutions such as banks, broker-dealers
or MSBs that knowingly participate in a
criminal scheme

•  Purchasing digital currencies in cash via

direct contact with the sellers or online sites
that facilitate such transactions

In instances where criminals are dealing in large
quantities  of  cash,  such  as  narcotics  trafficking,
placement  can  reduce  the  risks  and  logistical
difficulties  of  storing  and  moving  large  volumes
of currency.

Placement  is  typically  viewed  as  the  stage  in
which  launderers  are  most  vulnerable  to  detec-
tion.  Injecting  large  amounts  of  funds  into  the
financial system can lead to scrutiny from finan-
cial  institutions  and  initiate  reporting  to  law
enforcement  or  regulatory  agencies.  Several
examples  of  placement,  such  as  structuring  and
bulk  cash  smuggling,  will  be  discussed  in  more
detail later in the chapter.

2. LAYERING
Layering,  the  second  stage,  separates  criminal
proceeds  from  their  source  and  origin  through
layers  of  transactions.  This  means  separating

THE THREE STAGES OF
MONEY LAUNDERING
One  of  the  widely  accepted  precepts  of  money
laundering is that it is a process with three major
stages. While not every act of money laundering
necessarily executes each of these three steps, it
is still a viable investigation methodology.

1. PLACEMENT
Broadly, placement represents the initial entry of
funds  into  the  financial  system.  In  many  scenar-
ios this is the physical movement of the cash pro-
ceeds  of  a  financial  or  other  crime  into  a  finan-
cial  institution,  such  as  a  bank,  money  services
business or securities broker-dealer. The primary
goal  of  placement  is  to  gain  access  to  the  finan-
cial system, while distancing funds or assets from
their illicit source and origin.

As the first step in the money laundering process,
placement  is  often  conducted  in  cash,  but  does
not  need  to  be.  It  can  take  advantage  of  tradi-
tional or non-traditional financial institutions, as
well as a wide range of non-financial entities.

Some common placement methods include:

•  Structured deposits, or deposits of cash in
financial institutions in amounts below a
jurisdiction’s currency reporting threshold

the  criminal  proceeds  and  their  source  by  the
creation  of  layers  of  financial  transactions  that
disguise their flow and reduce their ability to be
traced. It often involves multiple participants and
entities, like shell corporations and cross- border
transactions.

The more complex and numerous the layers con-
structed  by  the  financial  or  other  criminal,  the

more difficult it is to uncover the location of the
funds,  establish  their  susceptibility  to  recovery,
and pin the crime on the perpetrator.

Electronic  fund  transfers  are  probably  the  most
important  layering  method  that  money  launder-
ers  use.  Millions  of  transfers  are  sent  annually
worldwide  because  they  provide  the  advantages
of speed, distance and increased anonymity.

THE RUSSIAN LAUNDROMAT
First revealed by journalists with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP),
the “Russian Laundromat” was a name given to a complex money laundering scheme that moved an
estimated $20.8 billion in suspicious funds from Russia through banks in Moldova and Latvia, and
from there to financial institutions and businesses around the world.

The scheme was reportedly orchestrated by a group of Russian businessmen, some with criminal
pasts  and  most  with  ties  to  the  Russian  government.  The  arrangement  had  all  the  hallmarks  of
a complex money laundering scheme, utilizing weak points in the company formation processes,
legal  system  and  financial  systems  around  the  globe.  It  illustrates  the  ingenuity  of  sophisticated
financial criminals.

In simplified terms, the Laundromat functioned like this:

•  The perpetrators behind the Laundromat formed a web of shell companies in Russia and
transferred funds to accounts at Russian banks held in the names of these companies.

•  The scheme’s organizers also created a group of 21 shell companies in the UK, Cyprus and New

Zealand, under the names of fake directors and shareholders

•  The next steps relied on exploiting the legal system in Moldova. Organizers would create a

fake “promissory note,” or document indicating that one of the Russian shell companies owed
money to one of the shells in the UK, New Zealand or Cyprus.

•  Judges in Moldova would issue an order requiring the Russian company to pay the debt. This
created a seemingly legitimate business rationale to move the funds from Russian banks.

•  About $8 billion was transferred to Moldindconbank in Moldova, to an account supposedly
controlled by the court, and another roughly $13 billion to Trasta Komercbanka in Latvia.

•  As Latvia is a part of the European Union, the funds now appeared less risky and likely to

questioned by other financial institutions. The money was transferred from these banks to
accounts held at institutions all over the world.

The  Russian  Laundromat  was  unveiled  in  2016  and  has  prompted  investigations  in  several  coun-
tries, including the UK, Moldova and Russia. Three officials of Moldova’s central bank, along with 15
judges, have been arrested in the case.

A  good  understanding  of  the
layering  pro-
cess  helps  collect  evidence  that  can  be  used  to
prove  the  concealment  and  knowledge  of  the
perpetrator.

Financial  criminals  also  utilize  complex  asset
movement  among  entities  a  launderer  controls.
Perpetrators  of  a  laundering  scheme  can  cre-
ate  multiple  shell  corporations,  trusts,  offshore
accounts or even legitimate businesses, and shift
assets between them. These layering techniques
typically rely on corporate structures and vehicles
set up to disguise a money launderer’s ownership
of  multiple  accounts  and  entities.  These  include
shell corporations, trusts and offshore accounts.

A  good  understanding  of  the  layering  process
helps collect evidence that can be used to prove
the  concealment  and  knowledge  of  the  perpe-
trator.  Clearly,  as  in  the  case  described  above,  a
savvy financial criminal will not make an investi-
gator’s life easy.

Another  viable  method  of  layering  leverages
securities  and  financial  instruments.  A  money
launderer  might  make  multiple  trades  in  securi-
ties, such as stocks, bonds, options and commod-
ities, to conceal the source of funds, or purchase
securities and transfer them between entities the
launderer controls.

Other layering techniques can include:

•  Converting deposited funds into

multiple different financial instruments
or commodities, such as precious
metals or stones

•  Transferring ownership of accounts, assets
or properties between entities or persons
controlled by the criminal

•  Blending illicit proceeds into accounts with

the legitimate proceeds of a business

From the perspective of the money launderer, the
more  layers  involved  and  the  greater  the  com-

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

plexity, the better. Adding layers makes it increas-
ingly difficult to trace funds to perpetrator.

to  appear

3. INTEGRATION
Integration  puts  laundered  proceeds  into  the
legitimate  economy
legitimately
derived.  This  is  the  final  stage  in  the  money
laundering  process.  Once  the  layering  process
is  complete,  the  criminal  who  is  laundering  the
illicit  proceeds  must  make  them  look  legitimate.
Detecting  integration  can  require  complex  and
resource-intensive investigative techniques, such
as  forensic  accounting,  informants  and  under-
cover operations.

Competently done, integration makes it very diffi-
cult to distinguish between legitimate and illegit-
imate funds. Front or shell companies, real estate
transactions, bearer shares, trusts, limited liabil-
ity companies, international business companies,
nominee  ownership,  corrupt  bank  employees  or
collaborative  international  trade  partners  are
popular  methods  of  integration  used  by  shrewd
money launderers.

There are many methods of integration, but they
commonly  revolve  around  real  estate  and  asset
investments.  The  purchase  of,  or  investment  in,
actual  or  fictitious  assets  is  one  avenue  to  inte-
grate  funds.  As  an  example,  a  launderer  could
arrange  to  buy  a  property  from  an  associate  for

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

28

an  inflated  price.  Laundered  funds  thus  enter
into the financial system as legitimate profit from
a property sale.

Trade-based money laundering is a popular inte-
gration method to launder funds across borders.
This involves using false or over-invoiced import/
export transactions. Trade-based laundering will
be covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Other integration techniques can include:

•  Purchasing or investing in legitimate
businesses using laundered proceeds

•  Making investments in securities with

laundered funds

•  Business arrangements between entities
controlled by financial criminals, such
as zero-interest loans made between
shell companies, purported repayment of
debts between companies, false invoicing
schemes and more.

Lawyers,  accountants  and  intermediaries,  such
as  company  formation  agents,  can  also  play  a
role  in  integration,  with  or  without  their  knowl-
edge.  Launderers  can  use  consultants  and  other
third  parties  to  make  financial  transactions  on
their behalf, such as purchasing assets or making
investments.  They  can  also  set  up  fictitious  con-
sultancies to funnel money back to themselves or
their associates.

In  general,  the  use  of  secrecy  havens,  coupled
with  one  or  more  of  these  tactics,  allows  the
financial  criminal  and  money  launderer  to  con-
ceal beneficial ownership from corporate records,
utilize nominee officers, managers and corporate
directors as fronts, and distort the business lifes-
pan of the offshore entities that were purchased
or  established  for  use  in  the  money  laundering
activities.  More  on  secrecy  havens  will  be  dis-
cussed in later chapters.

Regardless of the stage or technique used, money
laundering  has  serious  economic  and  social

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

effects  on  society.  Among  them  are  the  foster-
ing of public corruption, unfair competition with
legitimate  businesses,  and  a  weakening  of  finan-
cial institutions.

MONEY LAUNDERING INDICATORS
It  is  always  advisable  to  visit  the  websites  of
appropriate  government  agencies  in  one’s  coun-
try to view the indicators, recommended training
topics,  suggested  best  practices  and  other  vital
information  that  can  serve  financial  crime  offi-
cers,  including  AML  specialists.  The  websites  of
many of these agencies and the umbrella organi-
zations  under  which  they  have  banded  together,
such as the FATF and the Egmont Group, are con-
tained in the References section of this Manual.

Searching open-source information is a vital ele-
ment  of  financial  crime  due  diligence,  investiga-
tions,  historical  reviews  and  analyses  in  all  sit-
uations,  especially  where  terrorist  financing  or
money laundering may be in play.

One  of  the  pioneers  in  building  public  and  pri-
vate  sector  defenses  against  money  laundering
was Australia. It was one of the earliest countries
to  establish  a  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  (FIU),
which  is  called  Austrac.  This  respected  agency,
which has been in the forefront of the world effort
against financial crime and its component, money
laundering,  since  1990,  published  what  it  called
the  following  “non-exhaustive”  listing  of  money
laundering indicators in 2009.

Austrac recommended that financial institutions
and other business organizations should include
these  indicators  in  their  training  programs,  but
warned  that:  “Money  launderers  and  terrorism
financiers  will  continuously  look  for  new  tech-
niques to obscure the origins of illicit funds to give
the  appearance  of  legitimacy  to  their  activities.
(Anti-  Money  Laundering  and  Counter  Terror-
ist  Financing)  officers  should  continually  review
their products, services and individual customers

to  ensure  their  internal  AML/CTF  systems  and
training remain effective.”

There  are  more  than  70  indicators  of  potential
money  laundering  that  have  been  identified  by
Austrac. We have grouped them below for clarity:

ACCOUNT PROFILE INDICATORS

•  Same home address provided for funds

transfers by different people

•  Income inconsistent with customer profile

•  Use of false identification documentation (to

conduct transactions, etc.)

•  Use of variations when spelling

names/addresses

•  Value of funds transfers inconsistent with

customer profile

•  Unusual customer behavior

•  Use of multiple accounts for deposits

ACCOUNT ACTIVITY INDICATORS

•  Account activity inconsistent with

customer profile

•  Account operated by someone other

than the owner

•  Common bank accounts identify and link

“superannuates,” facilitators and organizers

•  Purchase of bank checks

•  Purchase of bank drafts by third parties

•  Numerous loan applications for less than (a

specific dollar figure)

•  Same or similar methods used to acquire

more than one bank loan

•  Transactions inconsistent with

customer profile

AUSTRAC  oversees  the  compliance  of  Aus-
tralian  businesses,  defined  as  ‘reporting
entities,’ with their requirements under the
Anti-Money  Laundering  and  Counter-  Ter-
rorism Financing Act 2006 and the Financial
Transaction Reports Act 1988.

These  requirements  include  implementing
programs  for  identifying  and  monitoring
customers  and  for  managing  the  risks  of
money  laundering  and  terrorism  financ-
ing; reporting suspicious matters, threshold
transactions  and  international  funds  trans-
fer  instructions;  and  submitting  an  annual
compliance report.

In  its  intelligence  role,  AUSTRAC  provides
financial information to state, territory and
Australian law enforcement, security, social
justice  and  revenue  agencies,  and  certain
international counterparts.

The intelligence provided has been analyzed
by highly qualified AUSTRAC personnel who
use  sophisticated  tools  to  identify  infor-

agencies to investigate and prosecute crim-
inal  and  terrorist  enterprises  in  Australia
and overseas.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

THE EGMONT GROUP OF FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNITS
The Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units is an informal international gathering of finan-
cial intelligence units (FIUs). The Group, formed in 1995, took its name from the palace in Brussels
where the meeting took place.

The Egmont Group defined an FIU as a central, national agency responsible for receiving (and, as
permitted,  requesting),  analyzing  and  disseminating  to  the  competent  authorities’  disclosures  of
financial information: (i) concerning suspected proceeds of crime and potential financing of terror-
ism, or (ii) required by national legislation or regulation, in order to counter money laundering and
terrorism financing.

The goal of the Egmont Group is to provide a forum for FIUs around the world to improve cooper-
ation in the fight against money laundering and financing of terrorism and to foster the implemen-
tation of domestic programs in this field. The Egmont Group provides support to member FIUs in
the following ways:

•  Expanding and systematizing international cooperation in the reciprocal exchange of

information;

•  Increasing the effectiveness of FIUs by offering training and promoting personnel exchanges

to improve the expertise and capabilities of personnel employed by FIUs;

•  Fostering better and secure communication among FIUs through the application of technology,

such as the Egmont Secure Web (ESW);

•  Fostering increased coordination and support among the operational divisions of

member FIUs;

•  Promoting the operational autonomy of FIUs;

•  Promoting the establishment of FIUs in conjunction with jurisdictions with an AML/CFT

program in place, or in areas with a program in the early stages of development.

However,  financial  institutions  are  a  particularly
important  vehicle  to  criminals  for  the  disposal
and  movement  of  criminal  proceeds.  They  have
vulnerable  operations,  customers  and  relations
that can serve money launderers well.

Following  is  a  partial  listing  of  some  of  the  vul-
nerabilities.

CORRESPONDENT BANKING ACCOUNTS
This  is  a  bank  service  by  which  a  bank  in  other
geographic  locations,  often  called  the  ‘respon-
dent  bank,’  is  allowed  to  establish  an  account  at
the correspondent bank through which

it may conduct specific transactions. Many banks
have  multiple  correspondent  accounts  around
the  world,  which  allows  them  to  conduct  inter-
national  financial  transactions  for  themselves
and  their  customers  where  they  have  no  phys-
ical  presence.  Large  global  banks  often  act  as
correspondents for many other banks worldwide.
These so-called respondent banks receive various
services  through  their  correspondent  accounts,
including  wire  transfers,  foreign  exchange  ser-
vices,  cash  management,  check  clearing  and
other services.

Correspondent banking relationships often force
a financial institution to execute the transactions
for  customers  of  another  bank.  Thus,  the  corre-
spondent  bank  provides  services  for  customers
which  it  has  not  fully  identified  or  about  whom
it has no adequate knowledge of. Correspondent
accounts are also known for the large sums that
are involved in the transactions, thus raising the
stakes of the host correspondent bank.

It  is  a  best  practice  for  a  financial  institution  to
identify  the  true  owners  of  a  foreign  bank  that
seeks  to  establish  a  correspondent  account  and
to  examine  deeply  the  account  activity  that  is
contemplated for the account to protect against
laundering.  A  correspondent  account
money
must  also  guard  against  the  possibility  that  a

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

third bank may be “nested” in the correspondent
account,  conducting  improper  or  illegal  transac-
tions with that access.

It is also a best practice to prohibit the establish-
ment of correspondent accounts for foreign shell
banks that have no physical presence and are vir-
tual shams that exist only for the convenience of
money launderers and other criminal interests.

PAYABLE-THROUGH ACCOUNTS
Sometimes,  a  correspondent  bank  allows  the
customers  of  a  foreign  bank  to  conduct  trans-
actions  for  themselves  through  accounts  called
payable-through  accounts.  These  types  of  rela-
tionships are fraught with dangers for the corre-
spondent account for various reasons. For exam-
ple, the local bank may lack knowledge about the
foreign bank’s customers and the nature of their
transactions. There is also the possibility that the
foreign bank may be allowing transactions by its
customers that are prohibited under local law or
that  the  correspondent  bank  normally  does  not
allow to be conducted.

CONCENTRATION ACCOUNTS
Concentration  accounts  are  internal  accounts
established  to  facilitate  the  processing  and  set-
tlement of multiple or individual customer trans-
actions within the bank, usually on the same day.
These  accounts  are  also  known  as  special-use,
omnibus,  settlement,  suspense,  intraday,  sweep
or  collection  accounts.  Concentration  accounts
are  frequently  used  to  facilitate  transactions
for  private  banking,  trust  and  custody  accounts,
funds transfers and international affiliates.

PRIVATE BANKING
Private  banking  is  a  banking  service  for  wealthy
individuals that provides personalized and often
confidential services. It is a lucrative, competitive
and worldwide industry that has played a role in
many  major  money  laundering  cases  in  recent
years. Private banking fees are often based on the

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

34

size of “assets under management” that the cus-
tomer has deposited with the financial institution.

ONLINE OR INTERNET BANKING
These accounts often offer funds transfers, cash
management, bill payment, loans and investment
services.  The  FATF  warns  that  Internet  or  tele-
phone banking creates distance between banker
and  client  and  lessens  the  physical  contact  on
identification  rests.
which  traditional  client
These  services  make  it  more  difficult  to  detect
money  laundering  because,  in  some  circum-
stances, normal monitoring cannot be conducted.
Online  banking,  by  eliminating  personal  contact
between the institution and the customer, makes
it more difficult to know who controls an account.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

MONEY TRANSMITTERS
These businesses transfer funds for customers by
receiving  cash  from  their  clients  which  is  trans-
ferred to designated beneficiaries, often in other
countries.  More  details  on  money  transmitters
will  be  provided  in  Chapter  11,  Compliance  Pro-
grams and Controls.

SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS
Broker-dealers, in general, facilitate the purchase
and sale of securities for individual and corporate
members  of  the  public  for  whom  they  maintain
accounts.  They  are  subject  to  significant  money
laundering risks.

NON-FINANCIAL INSTITUTION
MONEY LAUNDERING VEHICLES
As  stated  above,  there  are  few  instrumentalities,
entities, organizations or individuals that do not
pose  a  risk  of  being  used  for  money  laundering
activities;  financial  institutions  are  not  the  only
avenue  for  money  laundering.  The  following  list
and  brief  explanations  highlight  some  of  the
more  important  persons,  entities  and  instru-
ments  that  should  receive  scrutiny,  particularly
by financial institutions that are asked to open an
account relationship, or commercial entities that
are liable under global anti-corruption rules and
regulations.

INSURANCE
Life insurance and annuities contain the highest
money  laundering  risk  in  the  insurance  realm.
Money  launderers  can  purchase  insurance  poli-
cies and then later redeem them and request the
funds  be  deposited  into  a  bank  account.  Insur-
ance  policies  with  certain  characteristics  are
much  more  attractive  to  launderers  than  others,
including  transferable  policies  and  those  with  a
cash surrender value.

Also,  contracts  for  annuities  may  allow  the  ben-
eficiary,  who  could  be  a  financial  criminal,  to
exchange illicit funds for an income stream. Pay-
ments from annuities are usually made monthly.

CASINOS
Casinos  generate  and  receive  substantial  cash
and are vulnerable to money laundering via facil-
ities  they  offer  to  their  customers  to  manage
and dispose of money. Inserting illicit funds into
a  gambling  operation  and  then  cashing  out  the
funds as gambling proceeds is a popular method
to launder funds, due to the relative anonymity of
many gambling venues and the ability to conceal
sudden spikes in income as winnings.

In many jurisdictions, casinos are required to file
transaction  reports,  as  well  as  undertake  cus-

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

tomer  identification  procedures,  for  bets  or  pro-
ceeds  over  a  certain  threshold  --  the  same  as
other financial institutions.

DEALERS IN PRECIOUS METALS,
JEWELRY AND ART
Precious  metals,  jewelry  and  art  have  great
money  laundering  vulnerabilities  because  of  the
way they are traded and bought and sold. Money
launderers  value  them  in  their  trade  because
of  their  high  intrinsic  value,  convertibility  and
potential anonymity in transfers.

POLITICALLY EXPOSED PERSONS
For years, corruption of public officials has been
a  primary  concern  of  many  nations  and  inter-
national  bodies,  including  some  of  the  principal
players in formulating global standards on money
laundering.  They  recognize  that  public  corrup-
tion is a principal facilitator of financial crime and
a  destabilizing  element  to  nations,  contributing
to  poverty,  reduced  social  services,  and  poorer
fiscal  health.  For  these  reasons,  public  officials
or  Politically  Exposed  Persons  (PEPs),  are  now  a
focus  of  public  and  private  sector  efforts  in  the
control of money laundering.

Exactly who is considered a PEP can vary based
on the laws and regulations of different jurisdic-
tions. Most use some variation on the definition
provided by the FATF in its 40 Recommendations.

•  Foreign government officials, such as heads

of state, legislators, judicial or military
officials, officials in political parties, or other
more senior appointed officials

•  Officials at state-owned enterprises, such
as a government-controlled oil company
executive or administrator of a state-run
health system

•  Domestic government officials such as

heads of state, legislators, judicial or military
officials, officials in political parties, or other
more senior appointed officials

•  Officials of international organizations – This
includes non-governmental organizations
like the Red Cross and global sporting bodies
like FIFA, among others

•  Close associates can include business

partners, individuals connected through
a charity or non-profit venture, or even
social connections like an official’s
long-time friends

Not every government employee or official is nec-
essarily a PEP - the FATF’s definition only includes
government  officials  in  “prominent  positions.”
Some  countries  consider  only  officials  in  “prom-
inent  positions”  to  be  PEPs,  while  others  cast  a
wider net that includes less senior roles. Likewise,
whether or not domestic officials are considered
to be PEPs will vary country by country.

Some  institutions  have  developed  their  own
internal  lists  of  roles  and  responsibilities  that
qualify  as  “prominent  positions.”  This  practice
can  prove  useful  when  screening  customers  for
their PEP status, as required in customer due dil-
igence programs. Chapter 11 on Compliance Pro-
grams will feature more on this topic.

Apart from that, various nations, particularly the
United States with its Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA), the United Kingdom with its UK Brib-
ery  Act  and  Canada  with  its  Corruption  of  For-
eign  Public  Officials  Act  (CFPOA),  have  enacted
legislation with substantial extraterritorial reach.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

Often,  that  reach  is  augmented  by  the  simulta-
neous enforcement of the money laundering and
other laws in a particular case.

THE ODEBRECHT
CORRUPTION SCANDAL

In  March  2014,  federal  law  enforcement
agents  in  Brazil  were  pursuing  an  inves-
tigation into an alleged money laundering
ring  when  they  uncovered  a  much  wider
network of corruption and financial crime.

The  probe,  later  dubbed  “Operation  Car
Wash,” would expose an enormous bribery
scheme  involving  two  of  Latin  America’s
largest  companies,  the  Brazilian  state-
owned  oil  company  Petrobras  and  con-
struction firm Odebrecht.

Odebrecht  was  revealed  to  have  made
over $800 million in corrupt payments to
government officials to win contracts and
secure  business  in  twelve  countries.  Doz-
ens  of  high-level  political  figures,  includ-
ing  the  former  presidents  of  Brazil,  Peru
and  Colombia,  were  investigated  for  tak-
ing funds connected to Odebrecht.

The  sweeping  case  ultimately  led  to  a
record-setting  $3.5  billion  penalty  on
Odebrecht  and  its  petrochemical  unit,
Braskem  S.A  from  the  US  Department  of
Justice and enforcement agencies in Brazil
and Switzerland.

It is considered one of the largest corrup-
tion scandals in history. It is also a glaring
example  of  the  potential  money  launder-
ing  threat  presented  by  politically-ex-
posed persons, or PEPs.

These anti-corruption laws, which are addressed
in  the  chapter  on  global  anti-corruption,  place
greater compliance pressure on banks and other
financial  institutions  that  are  the  primary  focus
of  money  laundering  laws  and  regulations.  Not
only  may  these  businesses  be  involved  directly
in a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violation, they
may  also  be  implicated,  knowingly  or  through
“willful  blindness,”  in  facilitating  the  foreign  cor-
rupt payment.

THE ROLE OF LAWYERS,
ACCOUNTANTS, AUDITORS,
NOTARIES AND
OTHER GATEKEEPERS
The  global  financial  system  is  not  composed  of
banks  and  other  financial  institutions  alone.  A
wide  range  of  facilitators  –  professionals  who
move  funds  for  clients,  help  manage  assets  or
interact  with  financial  institutions,  provide  tax
advice,  purchase  real  estate,  or  form  trusts  and
legal  entities  –  can  help  open  the  door  to  the
wider financial system.

Like  financial  institutions,  they,  too,  are  vulner-
able to being exploited in money laundering and
financial crime schemes. These professionals are
often  referred  to  as  “gatekeepers”  because  they
can provide “access (knowingly or unwittingly) to
various functions that might help a criminal with
funds to move or conceal, per the FATF.

Types  of  professions  considered  to  be  gatekeep-
ers  can  vary  somewhat  by  jurisdiction  –  profes-
sions can have different abilities, roles and limita-
tions in different countries.

For  examples,  notaries  in  many  countries  with
civil law systems – such as Latin American coun-
tries  and  most  European  countries  –  can  help
clients form companies, create trusts, draft con-
tracts  and  provide  many  other  legal  services.  In
other countries, such as the US and UK, notaries
play a much more limited role, primarily acting as
witnesses when important documents are signed.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

Recognizing the roles and abilities that different
types of gatekeepers possess in your jurisdiction
will help you better identify and assess their risks.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS
FOR GATEKEEPERS
The  FATF  and  certain  other  international  stan-
dard-setting  bodies  recommend  that  jurisdic-
tions  impose  AML/CTF  regulations  on  gate-
keeper roles.

In  2003,  the  FATF  recommended  that  gatekeep-
ers  be  considered  Designated  Non-Financial
Businesses  and  Professions  (DNFBPs),  which
would  make  them  subject  to  compliance  with
the regulatory framework laid out in the 40 Rec-
ommendations.

This  would  generally  mean  that  gatekeepers  are
expected to implement AML compliance control
using  a  risk-based  approach,  similar  to  require-
ments  for  financial  institutions.  This  includes
the following:

•  Implementing customer
identification measures

•  Conducting due diligence on clients

and transactions for AML and
financial crime risks

•  Reporting on suspicious transactions or

client activity to their jurisdiction’s financial
intelligence unit

•  Maintaining records in the case they are
needed for regulatory compliance or law
enforcement investigations.

Not  every  country  has  adopted  this  regulatory
framework for gatekeepers. In many Latin Amer-
ican,  Asian  and  European  countries,  most  gate-
keeper  professions  are  subject  to  AML  compli-
ance regulations. In the US and Canada, lawyers
and  other  legal  professionals  have  no  govern-
ment-mandated regulations, only voluntary stan-
dards put forth by industry groups.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

tain types of clients and provide certain low-risk
services.  If  a  gatekeeper  does  not  generally  pro-
vide  services  that  facilitate  transactions,  hold
assets  or  create  or  manage  legal  entities,  only
has domestic clients, and/or interacts with their
clients  face-to-face,  then  they  would  generally
be  considered  lower-risk  than  other  types  of
gatekeepers.

One final factor that can impact gatekeeper risk
is “professional secrecy.” In many countries, some
gatekeeper  roles,  such  as  attorneys,  have  tradi-
tionally  enjoyed  a  high  level  of  secrecy  in  their
dealings  with  clients.  In  some  countries,  this
secrecy  is  legally  mandated.  One  example  of
“professional secrecy” is the attorney-client privi-
lege in jurisdictions, such as the US.

REAL PROPERTY AND
MONEY LAUNDERING
Also  known  as  asset  conversion  and  typically
done  during  the  integration  phase  of  money
laundering, this is the purchase of goods -- typ-
ically high-value and portable items such as gold,
precious  stones  or  vehicles.  Real  estate  is  also  a
common target for asset conversion schemes. We
will focus on vehicles and real property here; pre-
cious metals and art are discussed elsewhere in
this chapter.

ASSESSING THE RISKS OF GATEKEEPERS
Gatekeepers  are  generally  considered  a  medium
to high risk by banks and other financial institu-
tions that might hold accounts or conduct trans-
actions  with  these  professions.  Certain  services
provided  by  gatekeepers  are  riskier  than  others,
and  the  types  of  functions  a  gatekeeper  offers,
along with the geographic reach and the custom-
ers served, will significantly impact the gatekeep-
er’s AML risk.

A  2013  report  on  gatekeeper  risks  by  the  FATF
assessed SAR/STR filings made by attorneys and
other  gatekeepers.  It  found  the  most  common
services  that  came  up  in  SAR/STR  reports  filed
by gatekeepers:

•  Real estate transactions

•  Formation of trusts

•  Formation of companies, and mergers and

acquisitions of existing companies

•  Trust and company services – i.e., acting as a

trustee or corporate agent

Along  with  the  nature  of  services,  the  way  a
gatekeeper  interacts  with  clients  impacts  the
risk.  Some  factors  that  increase  risk  include
the following:

•  Interfacing with domestic or international

politically-exposed persons (PEPs) and other
high-net-worth clients

•  Taking on the role as third parties to

financial transactions

•  Being a nexus to high-risk countries

Working with cash-intensive businesses

In summary, gatekeepers that provide higher-risk
services (such as real estate transactions) to high-
er-risk clients (such as international PEPs) should
obviously  be  considered  higher  risk  for  money
laundering and financial crime.

By  the  same  token,  some  gatekeepers  would  be
considered  lower  risk  if  they  only  deal  with  cer-

REAL ESTATE
Real  estate  has  served  as  a  vehicle  to  launder
criminal proceeds and disguise beneficial owners
since  the  earliest  days  of  the  money  laundering
era  in  the  1980s.  Criminal  proceeds  can  be  fun-
neled  to  real  estate  transactions  through  con-
tract deposits, down payments, mortgages, trust
accounts  and  in  the  construction  process.  Off-
shore corporations, whose true ownership is neb-
ulous at best, often serve as the owners of record
of real estate. Escrow funds maintained in escrow
accounts that are purportedly destined for legit-
imate  expenses  in  a  real  estate  transaction  may
actually be something else. Escrow accounts are
vulnerable  to  money  laundering  because  of  the
many  transactions  that  are  conducted  through
them  by  the  various  parties  that  are  involved  in
the  transaction,  including  attorneys,  title  insur-
ance  agents,  inspectors,  bank  mortgage  officers,
appraisers and others.

VEHICLES
Many  money  laundering  cases  worldwide  have
involved  businesses  that  sell  or  trade  various
types  of  vehicles,  including  automobiles,  boats,
airplanes and motorcycles. These businesses con-
front many money-laundering risks, including the
receipt of cash, transactions with the proceeds of
illegal  activity,  the  layering  of  transactions  with
the  proceeds  of  financial  and  other  crime,  the
payment of vehicles by third parties and more.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

MONEY LAUNDERING STRATEGIES
As discussed in the introductory chapters, finan-
cial  crime  schemes  are  incredibly  varied  and
diverse, and limited only by the creativity of the
financial criminal. So, too, are strategies to laun-
der criminal proceeds. As money laundering can
be  conducted  through  virtually  any  transaction
involving the exchange of assets or other objects
of value, it would be impossible to fully outline all
money laundering strategies here.

There are, however, methods that remain consis-
tently  and  globally  popular  with  money  launder-
ers, and several are briefly outlined here. Many of
these are described in more detail in other chap-
ters  of  the  manual.  Where  that  is  the  case,  the
chapter is given.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE PRICE
MANIPULATION
For  more  than  20  years,  well-respected  aca-
demic  studies  have  shown  that  the  over-pric-
ing  or  under-pricing  of  imports  and  exports  in
international  trade  facilitates  money  laundering,
and  other  financial  crimes,  including  fraud,  cor-
ruption and tax evasion. This is commonly called
“trade-based  money  laundering,”  and  remains  a
popular  method  to  conceal  illicit  proceeds  and
move  them  across  international  borders.  Com-
modities  that  are  to  be  shipped  may  be  falsely
priced  in  the  shipping  documents  as  higher  or

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

40

lower to accommodate the direction in which the
money  launderer  wishes  to  move  the  money.  To
provide the trade transaction with an air of legit-
imacy, the money launderers may choose to use
a  financial  institution  to  obtain  trade  financing
and the documentation that goes with it. A more
thorough  examination  of  trade-based  money
laundering  can  be  found  in  Chapter  10,  Money
and Commodities Flow.

BLACK MARKET PESO EXCHANGE (BMPE)
In simple terms, this is a process by which money
derived  from  illegal  activity  in  one  country  is
purchased by peso brokers, who sell currency or
monetary  instruments  to  legitimate  businesses.
This  method  is  also  widely  used  for  legitimate
purposes  in  many  countries,  including  Colom-
bia.  A  more  thorough  description  of  BMPE,  as  it
is  commonly  known,  is  available  in  Chapter  10,
Money and Commodities Flow.

PREPAID CARDS AND E-CASH
Smart cards are an ever-present money launder-
ing threat because they store value in electronic
form  that  serves  as  the  equivalent  of  currency.
Some  countries  allow  prepaid,  or  “smart”  cards,
to carry unlimited value, while others place mon-
etary  limits  on  them.  More  on  prepaid  cards,
virtual  currencies  and  other  evolving  payment
systems can be found in Chapter 10, Money and
Commodities Flow.

SMURFING
Smurfing, which is sometimes called structuring,
is a well-known money laundering method that is
considered  a  crime  in  most  countries.  Smurfing
involves dividing illegal proceeds between multi-
ple  persons,  known  as  “smurfs,”  who  then  make
multiple  deposits  into  many  separate  accounts,
often  at  different  institutions,  to  avoid  report-
ing thresholds.

These  smaller  deposits  can  then  be  transferred
and  consolidated  into  a  single  account.  Smurf-
ing  can  be  difficult  to  detect  because  there  is

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

frequently  no  apparent  connection  between  the
various accounts and deposits involved.

STRUCTURING
Structuring  is  a  close  companion  to  smurfing.
Structuring  involves  splitting  up  funds  into  mul-
tiple  deposits  below  certain  thresholds  to  avoid
triggering  reporting  requirements.  Most  juris-
dictions  have
imposed  regulations  requiring
many  types  of  financial  institutions  to  report
transactions  above  a  certain  amount.  In  the  US,
for  example,  institutions  are  required  to  file  a
Currency  Transaction  Report  (CTR)  for  depos-
its  above  $10,000.  Structuring  of  deposits  aims
to  avoid  this  reporting  requirement  and  escape
detection of federal authorities.

In many jurisdictions, structuring is illegal in and
of itself, and institutions are required to monitor
for patterns of deposits that indicate structuring
is taking place.

BULK CASH SMUGGLING
Criminal operations, such as narcotics or human
trafficking, often generate large amounts of hard
currency. In order for this cash to be concealed,
placed within the financial system or utilized by
a financial institution, it often must be smuggled
into  another  jurisdiction.  This  is  referred  to  as
bulk cash smuggling.

While  the  term  is  sometimes  used  to  describe
the movement of large amounts of cash within a
jurisdiction,  typically  bulk  cash  smuggling  takes
place  across  national  or  jurisdictional  bound-
aries.  Many  jurisdictions  have  laws  prohibiting
bulk  cash  smuggling,  as  it  can  violate  reporting
requirements for cross-border currency transac-
tions above a certain threshold.

In one example of a typical bulk cash smuggling
operation,  money  from  the  sale  of  narcotics  is
collected and sorted in a central location. Smaller
bills  are  exchanged  into  larger  bills,  which  are
then  packed  for  transport.  Once  prepared,  the

bulk cash smuggling to help financial institutions
spot the activity:

•  An increase in the sale of large denomination

notes from a financial institution in one
jurisdiction to another institution in a
bordering jurisdiction

•  Large volumes of small denomination notes
being sent by currency exchange houses
in one jurisdiction to their accounts at a
financial institution in another jurisdiction,
or sold by the exchange directly to an
institution in another jurisdiction.

Large  volumes  of  small  denomination  notes
being exchanged for large denomination notes at
an institution

cash  can  be  moved  across  the  border  in  a  vari-
ety of ways. It may be carried across in multiple
small shipments by cash  mules crossing  illegally
or legally, hidden in personal luggage or vehicles.
It  may  be  packed  in  with  consumer,  industrial
or  agricultural  goods  and  shipped  commercially.
Sophisticated  criminal  gangs  may  use  surveil-
lance  and  intelligence-gathering  operations  to
help  cash  shipments  move  across  the  border
successfully.

Regardless  of  the  methods,  bulk  cash  smuggling
operations  can  involve  financial  institutions  in
multiple jurisdictions at several steps during the
process, either to obtain high-denomination cur-
rency in exchange for smaller bills or to ultimately
place the smuggled cash. The border between the
US and Mexico is a prominent location for smug-
gling  operations  conducted  by  Mexican  drug
cartels.  Consequently,  US  enforcement  agencies
have assembled the following list of red flags for

CASH-INTENSIVE BUSINESSES
By  the  nature  of  their  business  models,  cer-
tain  business  organizations  pose  greater  money
laundering challenges than others for the simple
reason that they principally operate in currency.
Since the principal attractiveness of currency to
money  launderers  is  that  it  leaves  no  trail,  busi-
nesses that operate in cash, such as restaurants,
privately  owned  ATMs,  vending  machine  compa-
nies, retail stores and casinos merit special scru-
tiny for money laundering activity and should be
considered high risk by financial institutions.

Another scheme prevalent in cash-intensive busi-
nesses  is  blending.  This  involves  using  a  legiti-
mate  business  to  mingle  illicit  funds  with  legiti-
mately-derived  proceeds.  Often,  the  business  is
complicit  in  the  laundering  scheme,  or  is  wholly
owned or created by the launderer.

LENDING
Loans extended by a financial institution for any
purpose,  including  real  estate  financing,  busi-
ness  loans  and  other  extensions  of  credit,  have
their own money laundering vulnerabilities about
which financial institutions and other businesses
should  be  aware.  Due  diligence  procedures  fol-
lowing internal risk-based approaches should be
applied to the parties involved in a loan, including
the  ultimate  beneficiaries,  as  well  as  to  the  use
and  application  of  the  loan  proceeds.  Financial
institutions and others that extend credit should
be  particularly  alert  to  the  money  laundering
possibilities that arise from the collateral that is
provided by the borrower for the loan.

Money  launderers  also  make  loans  among  com-
plicit entities, usually combined with other mech-
anisms  like  offshore  accounts,  legitimate  busi-
nesses and shell corporations, loans and financing
arrangements. This can allow launderers to inte-
grate  large  amounts  of  funds.  In  one  example,  a
launderer could set up a shell corporation and a
legitimate business. The launderer can then make
a  loan  to  the  legitimate  business  from  the  shell
corporation, using illicit funds.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

STRUCTURES THAT HIDE
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP
Beneficial  ownership  is  a  key  concept  in  the
financial crime field. In simple terms, a beneficial
owner  is  someone  who  ultimately  controls  and
enjoys the benefits of an asset without being the
nominal  owner  of  that  asset.  A  person  or  group
can be the beneficial owner of a financial account,
security,  physical  property  or  nearly  any  other
asset.  A  more  complete  discussion  of  beneficial
ownership,  especially  as  it  relates  to  financial
accounts, can be found in Chapter 11, Compliance
Programs and Controls.

Beneficial  ownership  of  assets  and  accounts
allows  financial  criminals  to  control  illicit  funds,
assets or property while obscuring the criminal’s
connection to them and distancing the proceeds
from  their  source.  Most  sophisticated  finan-
cial crime schemes will take advantage of one or
more mechanisms and structures to conceal the
perpetrator’s  beneficial  ownership  of  criminal
proceeds. Several of the more common ones are
described below.

SHELL COMPANIES
Shell  companies  have  no  physical  presence,  nor-
mally  have  concealed  owners,  and  sometimes
project  the  image  of  being  a  solid,  normal  busi-
ness with funds that are legitimate. For the most
part, they are companies that exist only on paper.
They can hold bank accounts and conduct finan-
cial  transactions  while  providing  no  signs  that
they are a shell. Shell companies usually conduct
no business themselves.

There are many legitimate reasons to form a shell
company.  In  some  instances,  shell  companies
can make it easier to invest overseas, help shield
a  company  from  liability,  or  transfer  profits  to
reduce taxes in a way that is completely legal.

However,  many  characteristics  of  shell  compa-
nies also make them highly attractive to financial
criminals.  Typically,  they  are  easy  and  inexpen-
sive  to  incorporate,  and,  in  many  jurisdictions,

43

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

they  can  be  established  anonymously  through
attorneys  and  third  parties  called  “company  for-
mation  agents.”  In  some  jurisdictions,  shell  com-
panies  can  be  formed  online  through  company
formation  agents  and  with  little  to  no  informa-
tion  collected  on  the  beneficial  owners  behind
the shell company, for less than $1,000.

Most  importantly,  shell  companies  are  an  anon-
ymous,  or  at  least  concealed,  vehicle  to  access
the  international  financial  system.  To  further
obscure ownership, many financial criminals will
operate through layers of shell companies, which
can make it very difficult to trace funds or assets
back to the ultimate owner.

Consequently,  shell  companies  have  become  a
fixture of financial crime schemes of all varieties.
Almost any sophisticated money laundering, fraud
or corruption operation involves at least one shell
company at some point the process. Historically,
certain  nations  and  jurisdictions  have  become
popular locations to form shell companies. There
is  often  an  overlap  between  these  jurisdictions
and those labeled as “secrecy havens.”

Discerning beneficial owners behind shell corpo-
rations can be very difficult when conducting due
diligence or investigations. One potential source
of information is the corporate registry for a given
jurisdiction, many of which are accessible online.
The information that can be obtained from such
registries  varies  substantially  between  jurisdic-
tions, but it can include details such as the com-
pany name, the name of the company formation
agent, company directors or board members, and
sometimes a physical address for the company.

While  this  information  may  not  be  particularly
revealing in and of itself, it can provide leads that
can be useful for discovering the company’s true
owner. A 2012 survey of law enforcement agencies
in  the  European  Union,  for  example,  found  that
company  directors  and  shareholders  were  some
of  the  most  useful  leads  for  unearthing  benefi-

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

cial  owners  behind  shell  companies  in  criminal
investigations.

SHELF COMPANIES
A  similar  concept  to  a  shell  company,  the  shelf
company is a corporation that has no activity or
business.  The  name  refers  to  how  these  com-
panies  are  formed  and  then  left  to  “age,”  or  are
“put  on  a  shelf.”  Some  shelf  companies  may  be
completely  inactive  for  years  before  being  sold
off to a buyer.

There  are  a  number  of  reasons  why  buyers  may
want to purchase a shelf company, and some are
completely legitimate. In many jurisdictions, it is
simply easier to purchase a pre-existing company
than to set up a new one.

In other cases, a businessperson may have an eas-
ier time gaining interest from investors, securing
loans  or  winning  government  contracts  with  a
company  that  appears  to  have  been  in  business
for  several  years.  However,  those  same  qualities
of  apparent  legitimacy  and  longevity  are  what
make  a  shelf  corporation  appealing  to  finan-
cial criminals.

NOMINEES
A  nominee  is  a  person,  company  or  entity  into
whose  name  assets,  securities  or  property  is
transferred,  while  leaving  another  person  or
entity  as  the  real  owner.  Nominee  accounts  are
common  among  securities  broker-dealers,  who
can hold securities for their customers and trade
them  much  more  easily.  Like  all  the  structures
listed here, nominees can be used for legitimate
purposes. A nominee’s ability to conduct transac-
tions at a distance from the owner of assets, how-
ever, makes nominees a useful avenue for money
laundering,  particularly  in  the  later  stages  like
layering and integration.

FRONTS
In  general  terms,  a  front  is  a  company  or  orga-
nization  that  is  established  and  controlled  by

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

44

another  company  or  entity  but  that  gives  the
impression it is not affiliated or connected to the
entity  controlling  it.  In  the  financial  crime  con-
text,  fronts  are  often  seemingly  legitimate  busi-
nesses with a physical presence and actual oper-
ations, but whose primary purpose is to launder
criminal  proceeds.  An  example  is  a  restaurant
formed  by  an  organized  crime  ring  that,  while
open for regular business hours and serving cus-
tomers, mainly exists to take in money from nar-
cotics trafficking.

TRUSTS
Trusts are legal entities created by a “settlor” to
manage  property  for  a  beneficiary.  The  settlor
transfers property that he owns to the trust. This
property is managed by a trustee according to the
terms described in the trust. Trusts can be mis-
used for hiding money and hiding the identity of
the  true  beneficiary.  Trusts  are  convenient  vehi-
cles for money laundering and usually permit pay-
ments to beneficiaries that could disguise money
laundering.  Usually,  the  payments  need  not  be
explained or justified. The trustees are often law-
yers who hold the assets in trust for others.

BEARER BONDS AND SECURITIES
These are convenient tools of money launderers
because  they  belong  to  the  person  who  carries
them, thus the name “bearer.” Bearer shares are
transferred  by  a  physical  delivery  from  one  per-
son to another.

HAWALA AND INFORMAL VALUE
TRANSFER SYSTEMS
Hawala  and  other  underground  banking  proce-
dures are often called informal value transfer sys-
tems (IVTS). They are most popular with persons
from  Africa  and  Asia  and  involve  the  transfer  of
value outside the regular banking system. These
informal  value  transfer  systems  have  existed  for
centuries  and  facilitate  the  secure  movement  of
funds.  Persons  who  wish  to  send  funds  to  rel-
atives  in  another  country  place  funds  with  a
hawala banker. For a fee, the banker arranges for

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

the  funds  to  be  available  from  another  “banker”
in  another  country.  Later,  the  bankers  settle
their transactions. Hawala is attractive to money
launderers because they leave a slight audit trail
and  the  identities  of  the  customers  who  receive
the  funds  are  known  only  by  the  “bankers.”
More  information  about  ITVS  will  be  provided
in Chapter 10.

CHARITIES AND NONPROFITS
Charities  and  other  nonprofit  organizations  can
also  serve  as  money  laundering  vehicles.  They
have access to significant funding sources, often
have  a  presence  worldwide,  and,  in  some  juris-
dictions, are subject to little regulation. Moreover,
“donors”  can  often  make  contributions  to  chari-
ties anonymously, providing a convenient vehicle
to launder funds or move money across borders.

In  recent  years,  charities  and  nonprofit  orga-
nizations  have  emerged  as  a  significant  risk  for
terrorist  financing,  as  well  as  corruption.  Cor-
rupt officials will sometimes request that bribes
be  paid  to  charities  under  their  control,  as  will
be  discussed  further  in  later  chapters.  Terrorist
organizations will also use charitable operations
as covert fundraising operations to gather funds
from supporters overseas. Many of the same red
flags  of  money  laundering  discussed  previously
also apply, such as in these examples:

•  Charities and nonprofits that conduct wire
transfers to countries where they have
no operation

•  Charities and nonprofits that operate in high-

risk countries

•  Charities and nonprofits with a vague

description of their purpose and services

•  Charities and nonprofits that have no obvious

physical presence or operate from a P.O.

•  Box would both be potential

money launderers.

CORPORATE REGISTRIES
Corporate  registries  collect  and  store  informa-
tion  pertaining  to  corporations  and  other  legal
entities created within a given jurisdiction. They
are typically maintained by a government agency
or  department.  Depending  on  the
jurisdic-
tion, there may be a single registry for an entire
nation, or multiple registries for different states,
regions or cities.

As  storehouses  for  corporate  information,  reg-
istries  serve  several  functions.  They  record  the
creation  or  incorporation  of  a  new  legal  entity,
collect  information  on  that  entity  as  required
by  the  laws  and  regulations  of  their  jurisdiction,
and  typically  make  certain  information  about
legal entities available publicly. Registries exist to
identify entities for tax purposes and allow other
companies  and  financial  institutions  to  collect
information  on  the  corporations  and  legal  enti-
ties they are doing business with.

Due  to  the  widespread  presence  of  corpora-
tions,  both  legitimate  and  illegitimate,  in  finan-
cial crime schemes, corporate registries are key
sources of information in investigations, enforce-
ment  actions  and  due  diligence.  As  mentioned,
however, the quality and type of information that
can be obtained from corporate registries varies
substantially between jurisdictions.

In 2011, the World Bank conducted a global study
of  corporate  registries  to  determine  the  infor-
mation on legal entities could be found. The full
report, based partly on that study, is titled “The
Puppet  Masters.”  It  is  a  useful  resource  for  all
financial  crime  professionals  and  can  be  found
here:
http://star.worldbank.org/star/publica-
tion/puppet-masters.

Of the 40 jurisdictions surveyed, the World Bank
found  the  following  information  was  usually
available from the corporate registry:

•  The name and type of the legal entity

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

•  Date of the company formation, and date

when the company was dissolved, if no longer
in existence

•  Articles of incorporation and other company

formation documents, such as bylaws

•  A physical address of the corporation, or
address of the company formation agent

•  Name and address of a registered agent

for the company

Roughly  half  of  the  jurisdictions  surveyed  also
had  the  following  information  in  their  corpo-
rate registries:

•  Names and addresses of the legal entity’s

directors or officers

•  Names and addresses of the shareholders,
members or other legal owners of the
legal entity

One  very  significant  piece  of  information  was
missing from almost all corporate registries – the
beneficial  owner  or  owners  of  the  legal  entity.
Only one jurisdiction, Jersey, required this infor-
mation to be supplied at the time of entity forma-
tion. This fact points to the shortcomings of cor-
porate registries as a resource for financial crime
investigations.

More recently, some nations have taken steps to
address  the  lack  of  beneficial  ownership  infor-
mation  in  corporate  registries.  The  European
Union’s  4th  and  5th  AML  Directives,  instituted
in  2017,  require  EU  member  states  to  imple-
ment registries that collect beneficial ownership
information. In 2016, the United Kingdom began
requiring many types of legal entities to list their
beneficial owners at the time of formation in its
national corporate registry. Despite this progress,
beneficial  ownership  information  is  still  unavail-
able directly from the registries of most jurisdic-
tions, including the US.

Further  compounding  the  difficulties  of  corpo-
rate  registries  as  an  investigative  source  is  the

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

46

fact  that  information  in  them  can  often  be  out-
dated and inaccurate. Many corporate registries
are not updated on a regular basis, and most do
not conduct due diligence on the information pro-
vided, instead relying on the person or company
registering  the  legal  entity  to  provide  accurate
and true information at the time of incorporation.

Despite  these  weaknesses,  registries  can  be  a
valuable  starting  point  in  an  investigation.  Infor-
mation  obtained  from  them,  such  as  the  names
and  contact  details  for  registered  agents  or
shareholders, will typically require further inves-
tigation  and  verification  before  the  true  owners
behind a legal entity can be discerned.

Many  jurisdictions  have  national  or  regional
registries  that  can  be  publicly  accessed  online.
Additionally,  a  number  of  international  bodies
maintain websites that can either be used to find
corporate  registry  information  directly,  or  have
links  to  corporate  registries  of  various  jurisdic-
tions. Names and links to these organizations and
regional registries are provided below. In the US,
corporate  registries  are  maintained  at  the  state
level, and can be accessed by searching online for
the registry of a given state.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

THE US MONEY LAUNDERING LAW
Because it is one of the oldest and most powerful of
its kind in the world, it is helpful to study the pro-
visions of the US money laundering law. Enacted
in 1986, the US law has a specific “extraterritorial”
provision which, at the time of its enactment, was
unique for its far-reaching applicability.

This  US  law  is  proof  that  money  laundering  is  a
part of all financial crimes. Anyone who works in
financial  crime  should  understand  the  architec-
ture and “extraterritorial” reach of this law, which
carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. It
can be applied to anybody, for virtually any trans-
action or activity related to a crime, anywhere in
the world. The US uses it often against fraudsters,
tax  evaders,  persons  engaged  in  foreign  corrupt
practices and other financial criminals. The law’s
more than 220 “specified unlawful activities (SUA)”
are a prerequisite to prosecution and a catalogue
of financial crimes. These are also known as pred-
icate offenses. The law permits government civil
actions and the appointment of “federal receivers”
by  US  judges  to  pursue  stolen  assets  worldwide,
armed  with  US  government  financial  data  and
assistance from US treaty partners.

The  law  may  be  used  only  if  the  proceeds  of  at
least one designated underlying crime are present
in  the  laundering  transaction.  Without  the  pro-
ceeds of at least one of more than 200 SUAs, no
prosecution for money laundering can proceed.

It  is  important  to  note  that  not  all  the  listed
SUAs  are  US  crimes.  Certain  foreign  crimes
are  included  among  the  SUAs  and  may  serve  as
the  basis  of  a  prosecution  if  their  proceeds  are
part  of  a  US  transaction  or  are  conducted  with
a US entity.

The  law  asserts  “extraterritorial  jurisdiction”  if
the “conduct … is by a US citizen or, in the case of
a non-United States citizen, the conduct occurs

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

47

in  part  in  the  United  States”  and  more  than
$10,000 is involved.

•  Procure goods and supplies

•  Fund other ongoing operations

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

The  SUAs  include  virtually  every  US  crime  that
produces  money  or  an  economic  advantage,
including  fraud,  corruption,  bank  fraud,  copy-
right  infringement,  embezzlement,  export  vio-
lations,  illegal  gambling,  racketeering  and  even
environmental crimes.

The  SUAs  include  some  foreign  crimes,  such  as
bribery of a foreign official, embezzlement from a
government,  “misappropriation,  theft,  or  embez-
zlement  of  public  funds”  by  a  foreign  official,
fraud  against  a  foreign  bank,  extortion,  narcot-
ics  offenses,  kidnapping  and  robbery.  They  also
include  violations  of  the  Foreign  Corrupt  Prac-
tices Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act. By
including violations of the Foreign Corrupt Prac-
tices  Act,  the  money  laundering  law  raises  the
specter that a company or an individual could be
accused  of  both  offenses  simultaneously.  Each
violation is deemed to stand on its own.

It is also possible for an individual or company to
violate the money laundering law when conduct-
ing transactions with nations, organizations and
individuals  that  are  subject  to  sanctions  by  the
US or other countries.

TERRORIST FINANCING
Detecting and preventing the movement of funds
tied  to  terrorism  is  one  of  the  most  important
and challenging components of anti-money laun-
dering  compliance,  investigations  and  enforce-
ment. In some cases, it can literally be a matter of
life and death.

Money is essential to terrorist organizations, and
not only for carrying out attacks. Terrorist groups
need financing to accomplish the following:

•  Recruit new members, and pay

existing members

•  Create and disseminate propaganda

By that same token, money is the terrorist organi-
zation’s weak point. By helping to identify and cut
off these funding sources, financial crime profes-
sionals play a critical role in combating terrorism.

In  most  jurisdictions,  terrorist  financing  is  cov-
ered by the same legal framework established by
anti-money laundering laws and regulations. This
means  that  customer  due  diligence,  monitoring
and  reporting  related  to  terrorist  financing  risk
are an essential part of an anti-money laundering
compliance program.

Like other money launderers, terrorist financiers
have  shown  considerable  resourcefulness  and
adaptability  in  the  ways  they  move  funds  and
conceal  their  financial  activities,  utilizing  many
of the same channels and methodologies as other
financial criminals.

In  one  example,  the  director  of  the  Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network, the national finan-
cial intelligence unit for the US, stated that nearly
20 percent of international terrorism cases being
investigated by the FBI in 2014 had related Suspi-
cious Activity Reports and Currency Transaction
Reports  associated  with  them.  This  reporting
helped  further  investigations  connected  to  the
self-styled Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other ter-
rorist groups.

Consequently,  activity  detected  and  reported
through  AML  compliance  programs  can  be  crit-
ical  to  support  law  enforcement  efforts  against
terrorist groups. This section examines terrorist
financing  models,  methods  to  conduct  transac-
tions,  emerging  risks  and  red  flags  of  transac-
tions potentially linked to terrorism.

FUNDRAISING MODELS OF
TERRORIST FINANCING
Traditionally,  terrorist  financing  relied  on  rais-
ing  funds  from  various  backers,  moving  them
through  legitimate  and  underground  financial
networks, and ultimately dispersing them to ter-
rorist organizations or cells. This fundraising was,
and still is, often conducted in other countries to
be  funneled  to  terrorist  groups  operating  over-
seas, especially in conflict regions.

Fundraising could come from a variety of sources:

•  Individual contributors, ranging from small
amounts from low-level backers on a one-off
basis to larger and more consistent funding
streams from wealthy individuals.

•  Nonprofits, charities and foundations,

ranging from radicalized religious
organizations and their followers to sham
charitable groups that act as fronts for
terrorist funding. In some cases, nonprofits
may have some legitimate operations and
unwitting donors, while skimming funds
off for terrorist organizations. In other
instances, nonprofit services may be misused
to support terrorist groups, helping them
with recruitment, supplies or other forms
of assistance.

Not surprisingly, studies by the FATF have
found that non-profits providing services
within areas that have active terrorist
organizations are most vulnerable to misuse
by terrorist financiers. Nonprofits involved in
humanitarian services in conflict regions are
also at higher risk.

•  Legitimate businesses, operated or

controlled by the associates of terrorist
organizations. These may act as fronts to
accept funds directed to the organization or
have a portion of their legitimately-derived
revenues redirected to terrorist groups, or
some combination of the two.

•  Nation-state backers, which may be
ideologically aligned with the causes

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

espoused by terrorist organizations, or may
be attempting to use these organizations
to further their own ends. In some cases,
financial support comes directly from
government agencies, such as security forces
or intelligence agencies. In other instances,
the financing flows more indirectly through
wealthy and influential individuals connected
to governments, political parties or ruling
families, though it may still be sanctioned
by the state.

These fundraising models can pose a unique chal-
lenge to detection and prevention not necessarily
shared by other forms of money laundering. The
funds  flowing  to  terrorist  organizations  may  be
legally derived, at least in the initial steps.

For  example,  an  individual  “donor”  employed  in
the UK may withdraw a small portion of his legit-
imate  monthly  paycheck  in  cash,  and  use  it  to
send a money order to a family member overseas.

From one perspective, this transaction seems like
a  fairly  routine  remittance  payment.  Unknown
to  the  financial  institutions  involved,  the  fam-
ily  member  receiving  the  money  order  is  then
passing  the  funds  along  to  an  associate  of  a  ter-
rorist  organization.  These  types  of  transactions
emphasize the need for robust monitoring typol-
ogies  and  a  keen  awareness  of  the  geographic
risks associated with payments of all sizes.

Another  challenge  arises  when  terrorist  groups
sometimes  use  funding  to  provide  social  goods
and services. A terrorist organization may fund a
school or a medical facility in a region where they
operate, for example.

This  may  be  done  as  a  recruitment  tool,  to  gain
support  of  the  local  populace,  or  as  a  cover  for
illicit  activities.  These  social  services  organiza-
tions may open bank accounts, receive payments
and  conduct  their  own  seemingly  legitimate
financial transactions.

SELF-FUNDING THROUGH
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES
Although  the  fundraising-based  model  of  terror-
ist  financing  remains  prevalent,  terrorist  orga-
nizations  are  increasingly  turning  to  large-scale
criminal activities to self-finance their operations.

Terrorist  organizations,  such  as  the  Taliban  and
Al-Qaeda,  are  engaging  in  transnational  drug
trafficking  and  human  trafficking  to  raise  funds.
Others, such as the Islamic State and Boko Haram,
are  conducting  massive  extortion  schemes  in
controlled  territories  and  by  the  theft  of  com-
modities  like  oil  and  gas.  Trafficking  in  stolen
antiquities, illegal wildlife and assets like gold and
precious metals are also lucrative funding outlets
in recent years.

These  activities  and  the  financing  streams  they
generate bring terrorist groups more in line with
the  operations  of  traditional  organized  crime,
leading  terrorist  organizations  to  adopt  similar
money laundering methodologies – from complex
corporate structures to trade-based laundering.

Many experts have also noticed another worrying
trend – increased levels of coordination between
terrorist  organizations  and  transnational  orga-
nized  crime  rings  unaffiliated  with  any  ideolog-
ical  or  religious  cause.  These  relationships  are
usually profitable matters of convenience, driven
by overlapping territories, activities or goals.

Observers  have  noted  a  particularly  strong  con-
nection  between  narcotics  cartels  and  terrorist
organizations.  In  Afghanistan,  the  Taliban  has
long supplied narcotics cartels in Eastern Europe,
Southeast  Asia  and  other  regions.  In  2012,  a
United Nations assessment found that a third of
the Taliban’s estimated $400 million budget came
from  the  production  and  trade  of  poppies,  the
precursor ingredient in heroin and opium.

More  recently,  in  2016,  the  US  Drug  Enforce-
ment Agency arrested several members of a mil-

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

itant  division  of  Hezbollah  on  money  laundering
charges. The four operatives were reported to be
working with South American drug cartels, using
Hezbollah’s  international  network  of  members
and financiers to move cocaine and other drugs
to  European  markets,  and  launder  the  proceeds
on behalf of cartels.

This  blurring  of  the  lines  between  transnational
organized  crime  and  terrorist  financing  should
law
encourage  compliance  professionals  and
enforcement  to  dig  even  deeper  when  conduct-
ing investigations or reporting suspicious money
laundering activity.

METHODS TO CONDUCT
TERRORIST FINANCING
Like  others  in  the  money  laundering  space,  ter-
rorist  financiers  generally  weigh  several  factors
when  determining  how  to  move  funds  and  con-
duct  transactions,  regarding  their  speed,  cer-
tainty, expense and risk of detection.

Ideally,  financiers  want  a  high  degree  of  speed
and certainty, and low degree of expense and risk.
How this translates into transaction methods can
change greatly based on a terrorist organization’s
circumstances and geographic region.

For  example,  sending  $50,000  through  a  wire
transfer might seem to be faster and more certain
than using a cash courier to move funds overseas.
But  for  a  Taliban  cell  operating  out  of  a  remote
area of rural Pakistan, accessing the banking sys-
tem might  be more  difficult  and  prone to detec-
tion  than  sending  someone  to  physically  trans-
port the cash.

TERRORIST FINANCIERS USE A
VARIETY OF METHODS:
Cash couriers or mules. Physical transportation
of  currency  has  long  been  a  fixture  in  terrorist
financing schemes. Despite the risk of detection,
cash  couriers  can  circumvent  the  monitoring
and  reporting  that  might  be  triggered  by  mov-

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

50

ing  funds  through  the  formal  financial  system.
Couriers  can  also  be  very  useful  in  the  conflict
zones or underdeveloped regions where terrorist
groups frequently operate because cash is often
the only means to conduct transactions.

In  more  recent  years,  “foreign  terrorist  fight-
ers”  traveling  to  support  terrorist  groups  have
become  another  type  of  cash  courier.  Residents
from other countries traveling to conflict zones to
militarily support terrorist groups, often referred
to as foreign fighters, are not a new phenomenon.

However, after the Islamic State launched its cam-
paign to form a so-called “caliphate” and actively
courted  foreign  supporters  to  travel  to  its  terri-
tory,  the  number  and  volume  of  FTFs  increased.
Rising incidences of online recruitment and radi-
calization have also boosted the numbers of FTFs.

Many  foreign  fighters  traveling  to  support
Al-Qaeda,  the  Islamic  State  and  other  groups  in
Syria  and  Iraq  brought  currency  with  them.  In
some  cases,  these  funds  made  up  a  substantial
portion of a terrorist group’s budget.

Hawala networks and other informal value trans-
fer systems. Methods for moving funds that exist
outside  of  the  formal  financial  system,  hawalas
are described in more detail in other parts of this

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

Manual.  Hawala  is  one  of  several  informal  sys-
tems around the world, such as Fei Ch’ien or “Fly-
ing Money” in China.

Although they have existed for hundreds of years,
hawala systems came under greater scrutiny after
the September 11th terrorist attacks in New York
in 2001. Investigations in the wake of that attack
found  that  Al-Qaeda  routinely  used  hawalas  as
one of their primary transaction methods.

More recently, an attempt to bomb Times Square
in  New  York  in  2010  was  bankrolled  through
hawala  transactions.  The  would-be  bomber,
located  in  Connecticut  in  the  US,  received  two
payments  of  about  $5,000  and  $7,000  trans-
mitted  from  a  Taliban-linked  organization  in
Pakistan  through  hawaladars  in  Massachusetts
and New York.

Money  services  businesses.  Money  services
businesses  include  a  wide  range  of  businesses,
such  as  currency  exchanges,  check  cashers  and
money transmitters. While MSBs are covered by
the same AML regulatory requirements as other
financial institutions in most jurisdictions, many
do  not  hold  accounts  for  customers,  and  often
have  fewer  opportunities  to  conduct  in-depth
customer  due  diligence  or  develop  detailed  cus-
tomer  profiles  that  could  help  detect  suspicious
transactions.

Combined with the fact that many accept cash in
the  initial  stages  of  transactions,  this  can  make
them vulnerable to use to by terrorist financiers.
Larger  money  transmitters  often  have  tens  of
thousands  of  agents  all  around  the  world,  with
a  global  reach  that  is  unmatched  by  even  the
largest banks.

Terrorist financiers will sometimes exploit MSBs
to raise funds under the cover of remittance pay-
ments  from  immigrant  communities  located  in
other  countries.  In  recent  years,  fundraisers  for
the  terrorist  group  Al-Shabab  in  Somalia  have
attempted  to  raise  funds  using  small  payments

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

51

from  various  Somali  immigrant  communities  in
the United States.

ing suspicious trade transactions remains low in
many countries.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

Unlicensed  MSBs  are  also  common  in  many
countries.  These  may  operate  with  minimal
record-keeping and little to no customer due dili-
gence, increasing their attractiveness to terrorist
groups.  MSBs  can  often  move  funds  rapidly  and
at low cost, with cash available to recipients in a
matter of hours.

Banks. Despite the level of scrutiny and attention
paid  to  terrorist  financing  within  the  banking
sector, depository institutions, such as banks and
credit unions, can still be vulnerable to terrorist
financing transactions.

Counter-terrorist financing controls are not con-
sistently applied in every jurisdiction or at every
institution. Terrorist financiers have been known
to  exploit  correspondent  accounts  held  by  insti-
tutions  with  weak  controls  to  move  substantial
amounts  of  funds.  In  less  common  but  nota-
ble  cases,  financiers  have  essentially  taken  over
compromised  banks  to  hold  funds  or  conduct
transactions.

Like  other  forms  of  money  laundering,  terrorist
financing  can  stay  under  the  radar  by  utilizing
small transactions, or seemingly legitimate trans-
actions, between individuals or business entities.
In  one  older  but  still  notable  example,  the  Sep-
tember 11 attacks were largely financed by trans-
actions  that  moved  through  large  regional  and
international US banks headquartered in the US.

Trade-based  money  laundering  and  commod-
ities  movement  (TBML).  With  terrorist  groups
moving  closer  to  transnational  organized  crime
in  their  operational  structure  and  activities,
their increased use of trade as a money-launder-
ing  vehicle  is  no  surprise.  TBML  offers  the  abil-
ity  to  move  large  amounts  of  funds  across  bor-
ders,  and,  although  governments  have  boosted
efforts  at  trade  transparency,  the  risk  of  detect-

Some  terrorist  groups  have  also  utilized  gold,
diamonds and other precious metals and stones
as a means of financing. Precious stones, in par-
ticular,  are  high-value  assets  that  can  be  easily
transported,  concealed  and  converted  into  cur-
rency in another jurisdiction. Many countries in
the Middle East and Asia have thriving gold mar-
kets,  making  it  easy  to  transfer  gold  into  cash
and less likely that large transactions in gold will
seem out of place.

Prepaid and stored-value cards. In 2015, a group
of individuals paid for hotel rooms in Paris using
prepaid  cards.  The  next  day,  these  individuals
carried  out  a  terrorist  attack  on  the  Bataclan
nightclub and surrounding areas in the city that
left 130 dead and many others injured.

This incident raised the scrutiny on prepaid cards
as  a  tool  for  financing  terrorist  attacks.  Stored-
value  cards  that  are  rechargeable  or  tied  to  an
account  often  require  more  rigorous  due  dili-
gence  and  monitoring  of  customer  usage.  How-
ever,  lower-value  cards  that  cannot  be  reloaded
and  are  often  purchasable  in  cash  are  still  avail-
able in many jurisdictions, with few to no restric-
tions on who purchases them.

Because  they  are  highly  portable  and  easy  to
conceal,  prepaid  cards  may  be  a  viable  funding
method  for  some  smaller-scale  terrorist  attacks.
Recently,  the  European  Union  tightened  reg-
ulations  on  prepaid  cards  to  reduce  the  dollar
threshold of cards that could be purchased with-
out customer identification and documentation.

EMERGING RISKS AND
TERRORIST FINANCING
Like  all  financial  criminals,  terrorist  financiers
will exploit any and all methods available to obtain
and move funds. This includes new payment sys-
tems,  online  tools  to  solicit  donations  and  fraud
schemes to raise funds, among other mechanisms.

52

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

In the UK, individuals supporting terrorist groups
have  used  “vishing”  frauds  to  finance  their  own
travel  to  Syria  and  other  conflict  zones,  or  fund
others.  The  fraudsters  call  target  victims  on
the phone purporting to be bank officials or law
enforcement, and convince victims their accounts
were somehow compromised. The victims, often
elderly adults, are directed to transmit funds into
the fraudster’s account, or provide cash directly
to a courier who is sent to pick it up.

Once  received,  the  fraudsters  used  MSBs  and
sent small transactions under the reporting limit
to transmit funds to Middle Eastern countries.

SOCIAL MEDIA, ONLINE
CROWDFUNDING AND FINTECH
Social  media  sites,  such  as  Facebook,  Twitter
and Instagram, have provided an unprecedented
global  platform  for  terrorist  groups  to  recruit,
radicalize and self-promote.

Groups  and  individuals  affiliated  with  terror-
ist  organizations  have  also  used  social  media  as
a  straightforward  fundraising  tool,  posting  calls
for  donations  with  wire  transfer  coordinates  or
account information for funds transfers on Face-
book, for example.. In other instances, fundraisers
might use postings on social sites to attract inter-
est,  then  follow  up  with  potential  donors  using
more private and secure messaging applications.

In  the  wake  of  the  San  Bernardino  terrorist
attack in the US in December 2015, it was widely
reported  that  the  attacker  had  obtained  a  per-
sonal  loan  from  an  online  peer-to-peer  lend-
ing  service.  Although  there  was  not  a  direct
line  between  the  loan  and  the  funding  needed
to  carry  out  the  attack,  the  incident  still  raises
concerns over how a subset of new “fintech” ser-
vices could be used for terrorist financing. Peer-
to-peer  lenders  may  be  less  well-versed  in  CTF
compliance  and  less  regulated  than  other  types
of financial institutions.

To  date,  assessments  by  law  enforcement  and
national  financial  intelligence  units  have  found
limited cases in which terrorist groups are using
these newer methods to raise or transmit funds,
usually in small amounts. For the time being, use of
the formal financial sector, self-funding through
criminal activities, and techniques such as TBML
still appear to be decidedly more widely used.

However,  as  new  tools  and  techniques  become
more mainstream, it is likely that terrorist finan-
ciers will exploit them with increasing regularity.

FRAUD SCHEMES
Members  of  terrorist  groups  and  their  backers
have  been  known  to  use  a  variety  of  different
fraud  schemes  to  support  themselves  or  raise
funds.  In  some  European  countries,  sympathiz-
ers and members of terrorist organizations have
used fraudulent tax refund applications and gov-
ernment benefits to raise funds. They have used
credit cards obtained through stolen identities.

In  one  example,  a  group  of  individuals  in  Spain
faked traffic accidents and filed fraudulent insur-
ance  claims  in  an  effort  to  raise  funds  for  FTFs
traveling  to  support  the  Islamic  State  and  for
another group called the Movement for Unity and
Jihad in West Africa.

Organized  crowdfunding  sites  have  also  been
misused  by  those  seeking  to  fund  terrorism.
Crowdfunding sites enable individuals to quickly
and  easily  set  up  a  fundraising  page  and  start
soliciting  donations,  possibly  under  false  pre-
tenses  or  in  the  name  of  sham  nonprofit  organi-
zations. In some cases, donors may not be aware
their contributions are funding terrorism.

DIGITAL CURRENCIES
Some  individuals  have  gone  beyond  payment
cards and bank transfers, making the leap to dig-
ital currencies to solicit funds for terrorist orga-
nizations online.

In  2015,  the  US  arrested  an  Islamic  State  backer
named  Ali  Shukri  Amin  for  using  Twitter  to
spread information on how to use bitcoin to fund
the terrorist group, in part by sharing an article
Amin  had  written  titled  “Bitcoin  and  the  Char-
ity of Jihad.”

Bitcoin’s relative anonymity, the irrevocability of
transactions and the ability to move funds across
national  borders  are  all  appealing  to  terrorist
financiers.  In  many  situations,  however,  convert-
ing  digital  currencies  into  the  real-world  fund-
ing that terrorist groups need to operate may be
challenging and impractical.

As  of  late  2017,  law  enforcement  investigators
and analysts have noted relatively few instances
of  terrorist  groups  moving  substantial  amounts
of funds through virtual currencies. With digital
currencies  and  online  payment  systems  becom-
ing  more  common  and  widely  accepted,  this  is
likely to change in the future.

In early 2017, Indonesia’s national financial intelli-
gence unit reported that Bahrun Naim, one of the
country’s  most  notorious  militants  and  a  mem-
ber of ISIS, used online payment services, such as
PayPal  and  bitcoin,  to  transfer  money  to  his  col-
leagues to fund terrorist activities.

 CHAPTER 3 • MONEY LAUNDERING

LONE WOLVES AND SMALL-
CELL TERRORISM
In  recent  years,  the  rise  of  so-called  “lone  wolf”
and  small-cell  terrorists  have  posed  a  new  and
troubling  issue  for  financial  institutions  and  law
enforcement.

Historically,  many  terrorist  plots  have  typi-
cally  required  multiple  participants,  a  degree  of
coordination  with  supervisors  or  superiors  and
technical  skills,  such  as  bombmaking.  Lone-wolf
or  small-cell  attacks  involve  one  or  a  handful  of
participants,  and  usually  rely  on  readily  avail-
able  weapons  or  techniques.  Attackers  may  be
self-motivated  by  online  propaganda,  or  have
only limited contact with handlers from terrorist
organizations.

For  these  reasons,  lone-wolf  attacks  have  low
funding  needs  and  create  only  a  small  financial
footprint, with transactions that can be very dif-
ficult to distinguish from legitimate activity. The
attack on French magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015
was  thought  to  be  funded  primarily  through  a
6,000  Euro  personal  loan  obtained  with  fraudu-
lent documents and the sale of a used car. Com-
pared  to  other  small-cell  attacks,  that  was  a
relatively  complex  plan,  involving  firearms  and
three attackers. Attacks using knives and vehicles
already owned by the perpetrators require even
less funding.

A  report  by  a  Norwegian  armed  forces  research
group that looked at 40 terrorist plots in Europe
between  1994  and  2013  found  that  about  75  per-
cent cost less than $10,000. Some funding meth-
ods  used  by  lone  actors  and  small  cells  include
the following:

•  Self-funding through legitimate means,

such as employment income, sale of goods or
possessions, government benefits or income
of a spouse or family member.

•  Low level crime, including petty theft, small
scale fraud and drug dealing. There is an

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

54

increasing body of evidence suggesting that
lone actors and small cell attackers often
have criminal histories.

•  Small-scale fundraising, usually limited

to the attacker’s family, friends and direct
connections.

Detecting activity linked to lone actors and small
cells  can  be  very  challenging  for  financial  insti-
tutions. Some institutions have sought to create
lone wolf monitoring typologies to watch for the
purchase  patterns  sometimes  associated  with
these  attacks,  such  as  weapons,  body  armor  or
survival equipment.

Institutions  are  also  conducting  increased  due
diligence and ongoing review of customer’s social

media.  Online  radicalization  plays  a  big  role  in
motivating many lone actors, and, in some cases,
warning  signs  of  extremism  could  be  found  on
these individuals’ social media accounts.

RED FLAGS OF TERRORIST FINANCING
Due  to  the  overlap  with  general  money  launder-
ing  methods  and  techniques,  many  of  the  same
red flags covered in previous sections also apply
to terrorist financing.

The  Egmont  Group,  a  confederation  of  national
financial intelligence units of more than 130 coun-
tries, analyzed nearly two dozen cases involving
terrorism and identified these indicators:

CONCLUSION
Detecting  and  preventing  terrorist  financing
is  one  of  the  most  important  roles  for  financial
crime  professionals.  A  thorough  understand-

the starting point, but professionals should seek
to learn more.

By understanding common methods used to raise
and  conceal  terrorist  funds,  emerging  risks  in
new technologies and payment systems, red flags
of  terrorist  transactions  and  characteristics  of

 CHAPTER 3 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

Q  3-1.  Chuck  Smith  conducted  a  Ponzi  scheme  by  luring  innocent  domestic  investors
to invest. He claimed they would get a steady stream of payments over time and would
receive a handsome return on their investment. The transaction worked as follows:

•  All investors resided in Smith’s country and wired money to Smith in order to make an

investment based on his statements, which later turned out to be false.

•  Smith next moved the funds to an offshore bank account.

•  Smith then transferred some of the funds from new investors to previous investors,

claiming it was money generated by their investment.

•  Smith used the remaining funds to purchase cars and other luxury gifts to create the

appearance that he was successful.

The underlying criminal activity in this case is wire fraud. At which point did money laun-
dering FIRST take place?

A.  When the investor wired money to Smith based on his false statements

B. When Smith transferred some of the funds from new investors to previous investors,

claiming it was money generated by their investments

C. When Smith used the remaining funds to purchase cars and other luxury gifts to

create the appearance that he was successful

D. When Smith wired funds to the offshore bank account

See Answer and Rationales

Q  3-2.  A  compliance  officer  at  a  major  insurance  company  has  recently  noticed  a  pat-
tern  of  potentially  suspicious  transactions  from  a  long-time  customer.  The  customer  is
employed in a consulting position that requires her to travel internationally on an unpre-
dictable schedule, and she often resides overseas for extended periods. The customer has
several properties insured with the company for large amounts. In the past three years,
she has overpaid her premiums numerous times and then requested a refund be issued.
Concerned that the customer may be laundering funds through the overpayment of pre-
miums, the officer is investigating the transactions.

Which fact would BEST indicate money laundering may be taking place?

A.  The customer often requests that refunds be made by wire transfer to banks outside

of the country.

B.  The customer makes the overpayments at different times of the year and in

varying amounts.

D. The customer has requested that refunds on excess premiums be made to an attorney.

See Answer and Rationales

Q 3-3. A financial institution holds an account for a charitable organization whose stated
mission  is  to  promote  literacy  in  the  local  community.  The  charity  derives  most  of  its
financial  backing  from  periodic  fundraising  drives  that  take  in  hundreds  of  small  dona-
tions from individual donors.

Recently,  the  institution  conducted  a  due  diligence  investigation  and  noticed  unusual
activity in the charity’s account.

Which of these is a red flag for potential terrorist financing?

A.  The charity recently purchased a large insurance policy which does not have a

surrender clause and cannot be used as collateral.

B.  The charity does not have a long-term leasing agreement on a physical property in a

nearby town.

C. The transaction history indicates a pattern of wire transfers to countries with no

previous connection to the charity’s activities.

D. The transaction history for the charity shows a large number of small cash deposits.

Q 3-4. You are the chief anti-money laundering officer of a full-service bank, and you are
designing a risk-based customer acceptance program to determine the Terrorist Financ-
ing risks specific to not-for-profit (NFP) organizations.

Knowing the elevated risk that NFPs pose, which enhanced due diligence activity is most
essential for these types of client relationships?

A.  Monitoring the financial activity in relation to the stated purpose and objectives

of the entity.

B.  Obtaining a copy of the organization’s charter.

C. Establishing who controls the organization and its financial activities.

UNDERSTANDING
AND
PREVENTING
FRAUD

 OVERVIEW

For financial institutions, government agencies, companies and

individuals  worldwide,  fraud  is  not  only  a  constant  headache,

but a major operational and financial risk, in addition to causing

harm to their reputations. Fighting fraud is now an escalating

war.  Even  private  sector  organizations  and  government  agen-

cies with the most advanced tools and procedures to detect and

prevent  fraud  sometimes  feel  like  they  are  falling  behind.  The

technical advancements and globalization of fraud will continue

to provide increasing challenges to an organization’s ability to

manage fraud in all of its manifestations. Some of the key trends

today include the following:

59

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

•  Greater professionalism in fraud practices
through smarter attacks (especially online)
result in bigger payoffs, which, of course,
attracts more talented thieves

•  Increased “sharing” of fraud practices from
fraudster to fraudster, often facilitated by
online communications

•  More fraud perpetrated from

offshore locations

•  More fraud perpetrated by

organized crime rings

•  More technical fraud or cybercrime, such as
hacking and other Internet-related activities,
that go hand-in-hand with more traditional
fraud activities

•  More collusion between merchants,
fraudsters and organization insiders

The  increase  in  fraud-related  regulations  from
government  authorities  has  caused  a  significant
impact  on the  efforts of  private sector  organiza-
tions to better detect and prevent fraud, especially
in the areas of identity theft and account-takeover.
Regulations and governmental guidelines require
increasingly  tougher  fraud  prevention  measures.
Implementing  effective  fraud  detection,  preven-
tion and security regimes is a critical part of an
organization’s ability to control operational risk.

UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING
TYPES OF FRAUD

PONZI AND PYRAMID SCHEMES
A  Ponzi  scheme  is  a  fraudulent  investment  oper-
ation that pays returns to its investors from their
own  money  or  the  money  paid  by  subsequent
investors,  rather  than  from  profit  earned  by  the
individual or organization running the operation.
This  person  is  normally  called  the  “promoter.”  A
Ponzi  scheme  usually  entices  new  investors  by
offering  higher  returns  than  other  investments
in the form of short-term returns that are either
abnormally high or unusually consistent.

Perpetuation  of  the  high  returns  requires  an
ever-increasing  flow  of  money  from  new  inves-
tors  to  keep  the  scheme  going.  The  scheme  is
named  after  Charles  Ponzi,  who  became  notori-
ous  for  using  the  technique  in  the  1920s.  Ponzi
did not invent the scheme, but his operation took
in so much money that it was the first to become
well-known throughout the United States.

Ponzi schemes have received a lot of attention in
recent  years  as  they  have  proliferated,  particu-
larly  during  the  economic  downturn  starting  in
2008.  One  of  the  best-known  schemes  was  the
exceptionally  large  Bernie  Madoff  scheme,  but
Ponzi schemes occur in all shapes and sizes. The
Ponzi scheme eventually -- and almost inevitably
--  collapses  on  itself  because  it  is  an  investment
that  doesn’t  exist  and  could  never  deliver  the
returns it promises. At some point, the scam gets
so large that it cannot keep up with the “returns”
to  the  investors  above  them,  although  skilled
fraudsters like Madoff have sometimes managed
to run Ponzi schemes for years or even decades.

The Madoff scheme signaled a significant red flag
that  can  help  differentiate  Ponzi  schemes  from
legitimate  investment  opportunities.  While  the
rest  of  the  securities  market  was  declining  and
even  experiencing  low  levels  in  terms  of  share
prices  and  market  or  investment  fund  perfor-
mance,  the  Madoff  investment  vehicle  seem-
ingly continued to achieve impressive, consistent
returns.  The  façade  that  Madoff  created  for  his

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

victims  was  that  he  was  a  shrewd  investment
manager  who  had  an  uncanny  knack  for  invest-
ing in the stock market that other broker-dealers
did not have.

Fraudsters,  such  as  those  who  perpetrate  Ponzi
schemes,  are  able  to  take  advantage  of  even
wealthy,  intelligent,  sophisticated  people.  They
are very good at what they do and feed off of trust
and friendship. They use this as their weapon to
accomplish their goal.

Some  of  the  red  flags  of  Ponzi  schemes  include
the following:

•  Investment returns that are “too

good to be true”

•  Investment statements that show continued

growth or performance contrary to
market trends

•  Unusual/absent fee structure

•  Lack of substance behind the investment,
such as when due diligence reveals little
information on the investment or the
company or individual offering it

In  pyramid  schemes,  the  promoter  promises
big  profits  to  investors  based  on  their  ability  to
recruit  other  persons  to  join  the  investment
opportunity and not based on sales or investment
results. This is the primary difference between a
Ponzi and pyramid scheme, although functionally
they  often  operate  similarly.  Some  possible  red
flags of a pyramid scheme include the following:

•  Recruiting of new investors or participants
takes place in an unlimited chain, with new
recruits immediately recruiting others

•  Promotion or advancement to new levels of

the scheme or new investment opportunities
that are dependent on recruiting others

•  Excessive incentives to recruit other

participants or investors

AFFINITY FRAUD
This  type  of  fraud  scheme  refers  to  scams  that
target members of groups which share some cen-
tral  demographic  characteristic,  such  as  mem-
bers  of  the  same  religion,  ethnic  community  or
profession. Typically, the fraudster is – or claims
to be – a member of the targeted group, and, in
many  cases,  will  recruit  community  leaders  and
trusted members to contribute funds to the fraud
scheme, help promote it, or both.

From a fraudster’s perspective, close-knit groups
that  value  trust  and  community  ties  are  partic-
ularly  attractive  targets.  These  groups  may  be
slower to accept they have been victimized by a
fraudster and less likely to report to law enforce-
ment  or  cooperate  with  an  investigation,  espe-
cially if community leaders are involved.

In recent years in the US, affinity scams have tar-
geted  groups  as  diverse  as  Amish  communities,
active-duty  military  personnel,  Chinese  immi-
grants and Mormon church members.

In  many  affinity  frauds,  the  underlying  mecha-
nism is a Ponzi scheme, pyramid scheme or other
investment  in  a  non-existent  security.  As  such,
red flags will be similar to other securities fraud
typologies, including the following:

•  Investment opportunities with terms
presented verbally, and little to no
information in writing

•  Investors are pressured with a sense of

urgency. The investment is presented as a
“limited-time offer” or only a short window to
get involved

•  The investment is presented as an “exclusive
opportunity” or limited only to participation
by certain individuals with demographics
that match the group targeted in the
affinity scam.

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

stock who are unaware of the falsity of the
information become victims of the scheme
once the price falls.

•  Perpetrators of pump-and-dumps often
take advantage of “penny stocks” as the
means to carry out their scheme. In the US,
the Securities and Exchange Commission
defines penny stocks as securities that
trade for less than $5 a share and are
not listed on a national exchange. Other
countries use similar criteria. The low
share price and typical low levels of trading
taking place among penny stocks makes it
relatively easy to run up their share price in
the pump phase.

•  Short-selling or “scalping” schemes. The
scheme takes a similar approach to the
“pump and dump” by disseminating false or
fraudulent information in an effort to cause
price decreases in a particular company’s
stock. Perpetrators will short-sell that stock,
or bet that its price will decline, in order to
profit from the negative news.

Insider  Trading.  Though  most  often  associated
with  illicit  activity,  insider  trading  can  be  con-
ducted legally. Most jurisdictions allow company
“insiders”  –  employees,  officers,  directors  and
large shareholders – to buy and sell securities in
their own companies, provided these transactions

SECURITIES FRAUD
Securities fraud involves some form of misrepre-
sentation  around  a  “security,”  which  can  be  vir-
tually any tradable asset or financial instrument.
This  misrepresentation  can  include  intentionally
inaccurate  or  misleading  information  to  encour-
age  the  investment.  It  can  also  include  selling  a
security that is illegal in the jurisdiction in which
it is offered, or that simply does not exist at all.

Securities  fraud  can  take  many  forms,  including
insider trading, stock manipulation, stock options
fraud, “pump-and-dump” schemes, false informa-
tion  and  withholding  key  information  to  inves-
tors. Some common types of securities fraud are
described below.

In countries with stock exchanges, such as the US,
UK, Canada, Japan, China, Mexico, Singapore and
India,  laws  prohibit  fraud  in  the  offer,  purchase
and  sale  of  securities.  The  securities  regulatory
agencies  of  these  nations  monitor  the  capital
markets and regulate the conduct of the partici-
pants in order to prevent fraudulent activities.

Misrepresentations  are  basically  the  equivalent
of  false  statements,  which  are  defined  as  dec-
larations  or  statements  that  mislead  or  create  a
false impression and are made with the intent to
deceive, manipulate or defraud.

The  following  are  some  examples  of  the  more
prevalent types of securities fraud:

Market  manipulation  schemes.  Financial  crimi-
nals use two basic methods for trying to manip-
ulate securities markets for their personal profit:

•  “Pump-and-dump” schemes. The perpetrators
typically disseminate false and fraudulent
information in an effort to cause dramatic
price increases in thinly traded stocks or
stocks of shell companies (the “pump”), then
immediately sell off their holdings of those
stocks (the “dump”) to realize substantial
profits before the stock price falls back to
its usual low level. Any other buyers of the

62

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

are properly recorded and reported to securities
industry  regulators.  Trades  that  equally  benefit
all shareholders that are conducted by a company
employee  or  insider  are  not  considered  insider
trading. An example would be stock repurchases.

Insider  trading  becomes  illegal,  however,  when
an individual is buying or selling a security based
on  information  not  available  to  the  general  pub-
lic.  That  is  a  violation  of  a  relationship  of  trust
and confidence.

Examples  of  illegal  insider  trading  cases  include
the following:

•  A company’s officers or directors may trade
shares after they learn crucial, confidential
information, such as news of a merger or
acquisition, a new product launch, the
pending release of an earnings report, etc.
The information could also be negative in
nature. A company may be the subject of
an investigation or regulatory enforcement
action, for example.

•  A corporate insider may share confidential

information with a friend or family member,
who then buys or sells shares based on the
tip. In such a case, both persons may be
charged with insider trading.

•  Lawyers, public accountants or other
corporate advisory roles may trade on
confidential information related to clients
gathered in their professional capacity

•  Government employee trades based on

non-public information gained through their
employment can also violate insider trading
laws. For example, a regulator who discovers
sensitive data about a company’s financial
status during a routine examination may use
that information to trade in the company’s
stock, in violation of confidentiality.

indicators  of

Some
the following:

insider  trading

include

•  An individual buys or sells substantial

amounts of a company’s stock or
other equities shortly ahead of a major
announcement

•  A service provider in an advisory role trades
heavily in a company’s equities soon after
being engaged in a professional capacity
by the company

•  An individual with little or no history of
investing suddenly invests heavily in an
equity of one company, even borrowing
funds to do so

Stock options fraud. Stock options are generally
given as incentives to corporate employees. The
employees  are  given  the  option  to  buy  stock  at
a specified future date. The price of the stock is
set when the stock option is given. If the price of
the shares increases, the employee profits from it.
Stock options fraud involves backdating the date
the  option  was  given  to  a  time  when  the  share
was trading at a lower price. This guarantees that
the  stock  option  will  be  assured  a  profit  when
it is granted.

Prime  bank  note  fraud.  Prime  bank  note  fraud
has  become  increasingly  prevalent  in  recent
years. This fraud scheme typically involves selling
fake  deposit  certificates  to  an  offshore  account
to investors with the promise of quick and highly
profitable  returns  on  the  investment.  As  part  of
the  prime  bank  note  fraud,  the  perpetrator  con-
vinces the investor/victim to send money to a for-
eign bank. The money is eventually transferred to
an offshore account controlled by the perpetrator,
who  then  uses  the  funds  for  personal  expenses,
usually  having  laundered  the  funds  to  erase  the
paper trail.

Typically,  these  schemes  offer  a  guarantee  of  a
high  yield  on  the  victim’s  investment  in  a  rela-
tively short time. These guarantees, for example,

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

63

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

assert  that  investors  will  enjoy  a  profit  of  more
than 2000 percent in about one year.

Further, to establish legitimacy, the schemers will
claim  to  have  access  to  bank  “guarantees”  that
are  being  issued  by  select  “prime  banks.”  This
is  where  the  term  “prime  bank  guarantee”  orig-
inated.  To  appear  more  legitimate,  the  promot-
ers  use  the  term  “prime  bank  debenture,”  and
require  that  their  investors  sign  non-disclosure
agreements  and  non-circumvention  agreements.
They usually insist that these forms are “required
by the International Chamber of Commerce” or a
similar  international  body  in  order  to  complete
the transaction.

The
following

red  flags  of  prime

•  Excessive guaranteed returns

•  Fictitious financial instruments,

such as medium-term bank notes or
debentures, bank guarantees and offshore

•  Extreme secrecy

Equity Crowd-Funding via the Internet. A secu-
rities  option  which  makes  it  possible  for  a  start-
up  company  to  solicit  investors  over  the  Inter-
net or through social media with a lot less work
and  cost  than  might  be  required  for  traditional
capital  investment.  The  program  is  supposed  to
make  it  easier  for  new  companies  to  raise  capi-
tal and grow.

This is a relatively new and expanding investment
field. Because the screening is minimal, there is a
concern about it becoming a new avenue for secu-
rities fraud. Because investors that are attracted
to these small, minimally screened, and arguably
risky investments, they may become easy targets
for con artists.

Front-Running.  Securities  broker-dealer  firms
will  sometimes  receive  orders  from  clients  to
buy  or  sell  a  security  which  are  likely  to  impact
the  security’s  price.  This  is  especially  true  of
firms  with  large  institutional  clients,  who  may
be  transacting  in  large  quantities  of  securities.
An  employee  of  the  broker-dealer  could  trade

ahead  of  executing  the  client’s  order,  then  take
advantage  of  the  price  change  for  his  own  ben-
efit.  This  “front-running”  ahead  of  client  orders
is  considered  unethical  in  all  jurisdictions,  and
illegal in most.

Similarly,  an  employee  of  a  broker-dealer  could
trade  in  securities  ahead  of  pending  buy-or-sell
recommendations or investment analysis that the
firm will soon be presenting to a client.

FRAUD IN LOANS AND MORTGAGES
Financial  crime  is  adaptable  in  order  to  capital-
ize  on  new  opportunities  and  present-day  cir-
cumstances. Thus, when there is a push to offer
home ownership to a greater number of persons,
the  incidence  of  mortgage  fraud  is  likely  to  rise.
When  a  new  government  program  is  created  to
extend  benefits  to  certain  persons  and  entities,
such as healthcare programs, financial criminals
normally find ways to abuse the program.

Mortgage fraud usually requires at least two per-
sons  to  collude  for  the  fraud  to  succeed.  A  per-
son  applying  for  a  mortgage  loan  may  grossly
inflate the value of the property to be mortgaged
or inflate his income to increase the chance the
mortgage  loan  will  be  given.  Often,  this  person
has  the  help  and  collusion  of  an  insider  at  the
financial institution that extends the mortgage.

The institution employee or other insider, in col-
laboration with property appraisers who are also
colluding, will obtain an appraisal with an inflated
value of the property that justifies a larger mort-
gage loan by the financial institution for which he
works. The inflation of the loan amount extended

by  the  institution  increases  the  institution’s
risk,  as  well  as  the  illicit  proceeds  the  conspir-
ators derive.

In  another  type  of  credit  extension,  a  financial
institution can be defrauded by the illegal use of
loan proceeds that a borrower has been granted.
The  fraudulent  application  of  loan  proceeds
increases  the  institution’s  risk.  The  misrepre-
sentation  by  a  borrower  about  the  ultimate  use
of  the  proceeds  of  a  loan  can  subject  that  indi-
vidual  to  a  separate  crime  that  is  recognized  in
many countries -- submitting false statements to
a financial institution from which a credit exten-
sion is sought.

material fact or other information on a mortgage
or loan application to obtain a loan, or to obtain
a  larger  loan  than  the  lender  would  typically
grant, if the application information was true and
correct.  Mortgage  fraud  was  one  of  the  leading
causes  of  the  housing  meltdown  that  occurred
in the US and other countries in the mid to late-
2000s. Mortgage scams continue to occur, result-
ing  in  poorly-performing  mortgage  portfolios
for  lenders  and  investors,  as  well  as  consumers
unable  to  make  mortgage  payments,  falling  into
default and becoming a risk for foreclosure.

Mortgage fraud consists of a number of different
methods and approaches:

Mortgage  and  loan  fraud  involves  an  intentional
material  misrepresentation  or  omission  of  a

Income  fraud.  This  involves  overstating  the  bor-
rower’s income in order to qualify for a mortgage

legislative

or  for  a  larger  loan  amount.  Prior  to  the  recent
housing  downturn  and
incentives
requiring  lenders  to  change  lending  practices,
these  typically  involved  “stated  income”  or  “liar
loans.” In these instances, the borrower, or a loan
officer working on behalf of the borrower (with or
without the borrower’s knowledge), would state a
specific income without verification.

Today,  these  types  of  loans  typically  involve  an
alteration  or  forgery  of  income  verification  doc-
uments, tax returns or bank account statements
in order to satisfy the income requirements. The
fraud  occurs  when  the  borrower  qualifies  or
attempts  to  qualify  for  a  loan,  which  their  true
income would not support.

is  another  version
Employment  fraud.  This
of  income  fraud  which  involves  claiming  self-
employment  in  a  non-existent  company,  or  a
claim  of  a  higher  position  in  a  real  company,  to
justify  the  representation  of  a  fraudulently  com-
piled income figure.

Occupancy  fraud.  This  usually  involves  a  bor-
rower that obtains or attempts to obtain a mort-
gage claiming that they will occupy the residence,
thereby  obtaining  a  lower  interest  rate  on  the
note.  In  actuality,  the  borrower  never  plans  to
occupy  the  residence.  In  addition,  larger  loans
are  typically  allowed  for  owner-occupied  dwell-
ings than for income properties, for which delin-
quency rates are substantially higher.

Appraisal  fraud.  This  pertains  to  a  deliberate
over-  or  under-statement  of  the  property’s  true
value to perpetrate a fraud. An over-statement of
value enables the property owner to obtain more
money  than  the  property  is  worth  in  the  form
of  a  cash-out  refinance;  or  an  organized  effort
to  generate  a  for-profit  mortgage  fraud  scheme.
An  under-valuation  of  the  property  enables  a
buyer/borrower  to  get  a  lower  price  on  a  fore-
closed  home,  or  to  persuade  a  lender  to  reduce
the  balance  in  the  case  of  a  loan  modification.
These  frauds  typically  involve  either  a  dishon-

est  appraiser  or  a  legitimate  appraisal  that  has
been altered.

Cash-back  fraud.  This  involves  deliberate  infla-
tion of a property’s price in order to provide the
borrower  with  a  “rebate”  which  is  not  disclosed
to the lender. The seller as well as the real estate
agent  can  participate  in  the  scheme  and  all  can
share  in  the  “rebate.”  This  scheme  requires  a
fraudulent appraisal to be successful.

“Shot-gunning” fraud. This occurs when multiple
loans  for  the  same  property  are  obtained  with
different lenders at the same time and for a total
amount in excess of the property value. This type
of fraud leaves lenders greatly exposed to losses
because subsequent mortgages are junior to the
first mortgage recorded.

Lender Fraud. This involves fraudulent lenders or
mortgage  brokers  who  victimize  unwitting  bor-
rowers or lenders who actually fund or purchase
the  loans.  Indicators  of  lender  fraud  include  a
lack of a license (lenders are typically licensed by
the  state  or  jurisdiction  in  which  they  operate),
loan  terms  that  are  too  good  to  be  true,  and/or
loan  documentation  that  is  incomplete,  blank  or
unintelligible.

Foreclosure  scams.  The  housing  and  economic
crisis that afflicted several countries has resulted
in an increase in the incidence of mortgage fore-
closure  scams.  Perpetrators  of  these  scams  tar-
get  people  at  risk  of  losing  their  homes.  These
include mortgage modification scams, as well as
“foreclosure  rescue”  buyers  who  try  to  rush  the
sale  of  house  without  the  proper  forms  having
been completed.

Buy  and  bail  fraud.  As  the  name  implies,  this
form  of  fraud  involves  buying  a  new  home  with
the intention of abandoning mortgage payments
on the old home. Although there are a variety of
reasons  why  a  homeowner  might  do  this,  some
less  insidious  than  others,  it  is  still  considered
fraudulent. Buy and bail schemes typically involve

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

66

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

homeowners  who  draw  up  false  rental  agree-
ments on their current home, and then use these
agreements as part of the documentation needed
to secure a loan on a new home. Once they have
obtained  the  new  home  and  moved,  they  stop
making payments on their old home.

FLOPPING
Fraudsters  often  seek  to  take  advantage  of  indi-
viduals  who  are  struggling  to  make  mortgage
payments  on  a  property  they  own,  or  to  collab-
orate  with  these  individuals  to  defraud  a  lender.
One  technique  referred  to  as  “flopping”  exploits
the mechanism of short sales to fraudulent ends.

In  a  short  sale,  a  mortgaged  property  is  sold  for
less  than  the  value  of  the  outstanding  loan.  The
lender accepts the sale price in exchange for set-
tling  the  loan,  as  this  might  be  ultimately  less
expensive or more expedient than foreclosing on
the property.

The basic steps of a flopping scheme are
outlined below:

•  A fraudster approaches an owner who is

struggling to make mortgage payments and
at risk of foreclosure with an offer below the
amount owed on the loan.

•  The owner communicates the fraudster’s

offer to the lending institution, who accepts
as settlement of the mortgage.

•  The fraudster immediately resells the

property to another buyer that had been
previously secured and makes a tidy profit.

While  somewhat  unsavory,  this  arrangement  is
not  necessarily  illegal,  depending  on  the  juris-
diction. However, flopping schemes often rely on
collusion  with  owners  or  realtors  to  drive  down
the sale price of the property or misdirect other
buyers away from making offers, and this is where
they veer into outright fraud.

To  convince  a  lender  to  accept  a  low  sale  price,
fraudsters  might  work  with  owners  and  other

associates  to  make  a  property  seem  less  appeal-
ing.  Parties  might  submit  inflated  or  falsified
repair estimates claiming that expensive work is
required,  or  physically  damage  the  property  to
discourage legitimate buyers.

In  another  variation  on  flopping,  the  owner  is
an  innocent  victim,  and  the  fraudster  conspires
with  a  real  estate  agent  responsible  for  selling
the  property.  The  agent  could  list  the  property
at an inflated price to fend off other offers, then
drop  the  price  just  before  the  fraudster  arrives
to  make  an  offer.  Or,  the  agent  might  steer  the
deal directly to the fraudster, rejecting any other
offers without informing the seller.

From the perspective of the financial institution
involved  in  the  short  sale,  flopping  schemes  can
be  hard  to  detect  without  a  thorough  investiga-
tion. One indicator can be repeated instances of
similar claims from property owners in the same
geographic area. For example, several owners in a
city who are all using the same real estate agency
may  submit  expensive  repair  estimates  listing
very similar types of damages.

RED FLAGS OF FRAUD IN LOANS
AND MORTGAGES
Like all other areas of financial crime, red flags of
fraud  in  loans  and  mortgages  are  situation-spe-
cific,  and  their  applicability  will  vary  based  on

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

67

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

the  nature  of  the  transaction  and  the  custom-
ers involved.

While  some  of  the  red  flags  below  are  spe-
cific  to  mortgages  in  real  estate  transactions,
most apply to other types of credit extended by
financial  institutions,  such  as  personal  loans  or
vehicle loans:

•  Discrepancies or inconsistencies in different
documentation, such as an individual’s tax ID
number, address, etc., that varies or appears
altered, within the loan file

•  Same information for multiple parties in
transaction (i.e., applicant and the listed
employer have same phone)

•  Information provided for an applicant’s
employment is vague, inconsistent or
unreasonable (i.e., employer’s address is
only a PO Box or matches the current
address of the resident; the company
name or applicant’s job title are generic or
non-descriptive)

•  Information provided for an applicant’s
income is questionable or unreasonable
(i.e., the income appears out of line with
the nature of employment, the applicant
reports high income but shows no deposits in
financial accounts)

•  Not an arms-length transaction, meaning
there are ties between the buyer and the
seller of a property, which can increase the
risk of collusion

•  No real estate agent involved in facilitating

the transaction

•  Loan applicant has history of defaults or

bankruptcies

•  Issues with property taxes; unsure if they
have been paid and who is paying them?

FRAUD IN FINANCIAL REPORTING
AND ACCOUNTING
An organization’s financial books and records and
accounting practices are vulnerable to a wide vari-
ety  of  fraudulent  manipulation,  from  deceptive
tricks to boost purported earnings to techniques
to conceal internal theft and embezzlement.

Fraud  in  financial  reporting  alone  is  a  financial
crime,  but  it  can  also  be  used  to  further  many
other  criminal  schemes.  For  example,  financial
records  could  be  altered  to  conceal  bribe  pay-
ments,  or  fictitious  invoices  could  be  generated
as part of money laundering schemes.

Although  not  an  exhaustive  list,  some  com-
mon  types  of  fraud  in  financial  reporting  are
listed below.

FRAUDULENT REVENUE RECOGNITION
Almost  all  companies  seek  to  consistently  grow
their  revenues,  and  companies  often  have  some
flexibility  in  how  they  choose  to  recognize
their  earnings,  as  long  as  record-keeping  does
not  deviate  from  “GAAP,”  or  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

However, a pressure to boost revenue can lead a
company to engage in improper sales practices or
deceptive accounting:

•  Hidden or side agreements in sales

arrangements. To create a short-term
revenue increase, company employees might
negotiate sales agreements that are later
altered or revoked due to hidden terms and
conditions. This is done to book the revenue
of the sale before it is fully completed. These
terms are made verbally or through messages
left off the actual sales contract and might
include refunds, exchanges, different
payment terms or right of return.

There is nothing inherently wrong with
allowing customers to make returns
or otherwise modify a sale when done
legitimately. However, it veers into the realm

68

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

of fraud when it is done outside of the proper
channels and with erroneously recorded
revenue without provisions for returns,
cancellations or other modifications.

•  Altering dates or holding open accounting
periods. By changing the dates on certain
documentation, like shipping documentation
or purchase orders, a company can
deceptively record revenue in one accounting
period that should have accrued in another.
Likewise, a company could improperly
extend its accounting period, holding open
its receivables to record sales that should
have fallen into the next period.

•  Creation of wholly fictitious sales and

customers. Although this technique is more
vulnerable to detection in audits, there have
been numerous cases where companies
simply falsified sales transactions, and
likewise created false customers to match
corresponding entries in their accounts
receivables.

FALSE INVOICING SCHEMES
False invoices are a multi-purpose tool in an array
of financial crime schemes - Providing cover for
bribe  payments,  or  lending  an  air  of  legitimacy
to money laundering transactions between shell
companies, or many other applications.

False invoicing schemes are also one of the most
common  methods  that  employees  use  to  mis-
appropriate  funds  from  employers.  This  can  be
done in the following ways:

•  Creating a fictitious invoice for goods or
services that were never delivered, and
submitting it for payment. An employee may
be acting alone, by submitting false invoices
from companies they control, or working
with others. In some instances, employees
collude with an organization’s vendors to
create and approve fake invoices.

•  Modifying a legitimate invoice, inflating its
value, or submitting duplicate invoices. An

employee could change the account details
on the invoice to an account under their
control, and then re-submit the original
invoice for payment.

•  Alternately, an employee colluding with a

vendor or other third party could inflate the
value of a legitimate invoice, and then receive
some percentage of the transaction back
from the conspirator. In both cases, the
employee would typically be someone with
access to the systems used for a company’s
accounts payable.

Vendors  themselves  can  also  engage  in  false
invoicing  schemes,  without  the  assistance  of  an
insider within the company. In this case, it is a mat-
ter of playing the odds. The vendor assumes that
a certain percentage of false, inflated or duplicate
invoices  will  simply  slip  through  the  cracks  and
be paid by the company that receives them.

Like  other  internal  fraud  schemes,  separation  of
duties  and  multi-step  review  can  be  a  powerful
tool to reduce the risk of false invoicing schemes.
This  can  be  as  simple  as  implementing  a  two-
stage process for approving invoices:

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

69

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

1.  One employee checks the invoice to confirm

it is for a legitimate product or service.

2.  A second employee reviews and

authorizes payment.

When investigating a company’s records for indi-
cators  of  false  invoicing,  red  flags  can  include
the following:

•  Invoices missing common details and
information, such as no address being
provided, a tax ID number is not given, etc.

•  The company name listed cannot be found in

the jurisdiction’s corporate registry.

•  The invoice and/or supporting documents

are vaguely worded or copied from
other invoices.

•  No purchasing order that matches the
information is provided in the invoice.

•  The goods described on the invoice cannot
be found in the company’s inventory, or the
services cannot be accounted for.

•  Multiple invoices contain the same

invoice number.

•  There are multiple invoices with the same

amount on the same date, or from the same
vendor on the same date.

•  The invoice contains errors or misspelling.

FRAUD IN OPENING AN ACCOUNT
Financial  institutions  are  vulnerable  to  fraud  in
many  ways,  and  the  old  adage,  “Know  Your  Cus-
tomer,”  is  as  effective  a  safeguard  against  exter-
nal financial crime as any government regulation.
One way to prevent fraud risk is to ensure that an
application  for  a  new  account  or  relationship  by
an individual or entity is fully vetted.

A  good  way  for  a  financial  institution  to  prevent
future  problems  with  a  customer  is  to  take  rea-
sonable  due  diligence  steps  when  the  potential
new  customer  seeks  to  establish  a  relationship.
The applicant should be asked to corroborate all
the  information,  and  the  institution  must  verify
the information.

At the earliest stage of a new relationship with a
customer, a financial institution must assure that
the person seeking to open an account or estab-
lish a business relationship is the true beneficial
owner  of  the  funds  to  be  invested  or  deposited.
If  a  business  organization  is  involved,  the  insti-
tution  should  ensure  that  the  person  seeking  to
establish  the  relationship  is  the  real  principal  of
the entity or can and will identify that person.

The nature and size of a relationship usually deter-
mines  the  degree  of  due  diligence  that  an  insti-
tution  should  take  to  investigate  and  verify  ben-
eficial ownership and the principals of an entity.
Financial  criminals  invariably  use  nominees  and
fronts in their business and financial transactions
to hide and disguise their involvement.

If  the  account  to  be  opened  or  business  to  be
conducted is of sufficient size and importance, an
institution or business should exercise enhanced
due  diligence  to  ensure  that  persons  are  who
they say they are and that no nominees or fronts
are shielding the true parties in interest. In situa-
tions of sufficient gravity and size, the institution
should  go  beyond  its  walls  and  seek  facts  inde-
pendently from appropriate sources and conduct
enhanced due diligence.

If  the  institution  or  business  confirms  that  the
beneficial  owner  is  not  the  person  who  appears
at  the  institution  seeking  to  establish  the  rela-
tionship, it should decline the relationship in the
absence  of  a  satisfactory  explanation.  If  none  is
provided, in addition to declining the relationship,
the institution should probably report the event to
the appropriate authorities as suspicious activity.

INSURANCE AND
HEALTH CARE FRAUD
Insurance  and  health  care  fraud  is  a  growing
and  increasingly  expensive  problem.  Although
health  care  fraud  can  be  perpetrated  by  individ-
uals,  the  largest  and  most  successful  schemes
usually  involve  health  care  providers  colluding

70

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

to  overcharge  a  private  or  government  health
insurance agency. Typically, the health care pro-
vider orders tests and services that are not actu-
ally  needed  by  the  patient,  bills  for  services  the
patient  never  receives,  or  bills  for  an  office  visit
that never occurs.

Health  care  insurance  fraud  costs  government
medical  and  health  insurance  programs,  such
as  Medicare  in  the  US,  hundreds  of  billions  of
dollars  in  fraudulent  charges  and  investigations.
Much of this money is never recovered, which is a
good example of the poor results of asset recov-
ery  efforts  directed  at  fraudsters  in  the  US  and
most countries.

There are many types of health care
insurance fraud:

•  Upcoding – billing for a higher covered

service than performed.

•  Using the wrong procedure code to get
something covered that would not be
covered under its proper code. A sign of this
type of fraud is that the provider tried the
non- covered code before.

•  Breaking up a “package” into individual

procedures, which is usually more
expensive. An example might be laboratory
and blood work

•  Setting up fake clinics, often involving shell
companies with no physical location or just
postal boxes to submit claims.

When a health care provider commits insurance
fraud, the costs can be greater than the monetary
loss.  Health  insurance  fraud  can  also  be  damag-
ing  to  the  patients  in  the  provider’s  care,  as  the
treatment or tests prescribed may be inappropri-
ate or even harmful.

One  of  the  most  common  forms  of  insurance
fraud involves insurance brokers keeping the cus-
tomer’s premium payments rather than applying
them to the intended insurance plan. These “bro-

kers” who embezzle customer premiums may not
even be licensed.

CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD FRAUD
A  lost  or  stolen  credit  or  debit  card  is  an  easy
source  and  target  of  fraud.  Even  if  the  victim
immediately reports the card as missing or stolen
- which most financial institutions and other card
providers require in order to limit personal liabil-
ity on fraudulent charges - a fast-acting thief has
adequate time to quickly incur charges before the
card is disabled.

In  recent  years,  credit  and  debit  card  fraud  has
moved  away  from  the  theft  of  individual  cards
and  toward  the  theft  of  large  amounts  of  credit
and  debit  card  information  through  hacks  and
data  breaches.  It  has  also  become
increas-
ingly  sophisticated,  with  organized  crime  rings
launching  complex  operations  to  steal  credit
cards  and  engage  in  hundreds  or  thousands  of
fraud  schemes  worldwide  in  short  time  periods.
More information on how data breaches play into
financial crime schemes will be discussed in the
Cyber Security chapter.

Credit  and  debit  card  fraud  schemes  include
the following:

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

71

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

•  Tampering with card readers at ATMs and
other point-of-sale locations, typically by
inserting skimmers to steal card numbers
and passwords.

•  Online theft of numbers through
compromises of online security.

•  Identity theft to apply for credit and debit
cards, such as “too good to be true” credit
card offers through which the fraudsters
obtain the individual’s personal information
and then use that to apply for other cards.

•  Physical theft of the card.

•  Internet fraud schemes, which involve the
use of unlawfully obtained credit card
numbers to order goods or services online.

FRAUD IN GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
Fraud in government benefits is generally perpe-
trated by identity theft. Using a stolen identity, the
fraudster can assume to be the proper recipient
of benefits intended for someone else. This type
of  fraud  is  typically  perpetrated  with  the  help
of  knowing  the  victim’s  identification  or  Social
Security  numbers  (or  other  identifier),  through
which access to benefits is typically verified.

Fraud  against  government  agencies  takes  many
forms.  It  can  be  as  basic  as  improperly  apply-
ing  for  and  receiving  benefits  of  small  amounts
offered  by  a  social  welfare  program.  Or,  it  can
involve  large  sums  under  large  contracts,  such
as those with military and aerospace agencies, in
which a contractor in the private sector inflates
costs or furnishes subpar materials to the agency
or performs improperly under the contract.

In  some  cases,  financial  criminals  even  recruit
the  help  of  prisoners  who  provide  their  identifi-
cations,  such  as  their  Social  Security  number  if
they  are  in  the  US,  to  pose  as  legitimate  appli-
cants seeking student loans, unemployment ben-
efits, tax refunds or other government benefits.

Some fraud in government benefits may actually
be occurring with “good intention.” This can hap-
pen when another entity is trying to get benefits
for a person without proper ID, and allows the fil-
ing of the benefits knowing that the ID provided
is not valid. While helping someone in need with
this  stolen  ID,  the  perpetrator  is  also  creating  a
separate victim of identity theft.

Fraud  in  government  benefits  can  often  involve
collusion  of  two  or  more  individuals,  as  well  as
collusion  between  outside  actors  and  govern-
ment employees.

INTERNAL FRAUD
Internal  theft  and  misappropriation  of  assets
by  employees  and  insiders  of  a  business  organi-
zation  are  rampant  in  all  countries.  A  business
can  take  several  steps  to  minimize  exposure  to
these crimes.

As in the case of financial institutions seeking to
prevent threats posed by the “enemy within,” the
first step businesses should take start at the door
of the human resources department. Hiring wisely
through  thorough  examination  of  applicants  is
crucial  in  minimizing  internal  theft  and  misap-
propriation.  Thorough  interviews,  vetting  of  all
important  aspects  of  a  candidate’s  background,
prior job and independent references is crucial.

Background  checks,  due  diligence  and  examina-
tion  of  criminal  records  are  also  indispensable
steps. Depending on the sensitivity of the position
and  the  potential  fraud  risk  it  poses,  companies
should also consider screening employees against
PEP lists, sanctions lists and negative news scans.
Not  all  of  these  screens  may  be  required  for
every  position,  but  they  could  be  applicable  for
higher  risk  roles.  All  of  these  policies  and  pro-
cedures  should  form  part  of  a  pre-employment
screening program.

ceptable  conduct  and  a  program  of  mandatory

business ties to the vendor, this may warrant
further investigation.

Financial
institutions  and  other  businesses
should  also  strongly  consider  establishing  an
anonymous telephone line or similar mechanism
that employees can use to report theft and other
dishonest acts.

This  reporting  mechanism  should  be  sepa-
rate  from  the  usual  reporting  that  takes  place
through the lines of business – In other words, an
employee  reporting  to  their  superior,  who  then
may  escalate  it  to  their  superior,  and  so  on.  If
there  is  no  option  to  report  outside  of  the  typ-
ical  reporting  through  the  chain  of  command,
employees may be unwilling to speak up for fear
of  retaliation,  and  will  have  nowhere  to  turn  if
their managers are the ones actually involved in
the suspected fraud.

Close  observation  of  employee  behavior  may
also  provide  telltale  signs  of  vulnerabilities  to
the  “enemy  within.”  Some  common  indicators
and risk areas for potential involvement in insider
fraud include:

•  Resistance to taking vacation/sick days

or refusal to share job responsibilities —If
an employee rarely takes vacation or sick
time, or is resistant to sharing their duties
with another employee, it could indicate
something more sinister than sheer devotion
to the job. This is particularly true of roles
with access to a company’s books and
records or payment processing functions.
Likewise, when an employee declines a
promotion or reassignment to a different
area of the company, this can raise red flags.

•  Employees with close ties to a vendor or

other third party—An employee that seems
abnormally close to a vendor or vendors
should raise questions. For example, if an
employee contacts a vendor more often
that is necessary for business purposes,
advocates on their behalf, or has non-

•  Sudden changes in the employee’s spending

habits and lifestyle—As obvious as this seems,
this red flag remains a fixture in internal
fraud schemes. If an employee suddenly
starts purchasing expensive luxury goods,
buys a house or other assets that don’t
match their salary, or otherwise starts living
beyond their known income, it warrants
careful scrutiny.

•  Employees that have overlapping roles
with access to the company’s funds or
accounts—A lack of clear division of duties
is a weak point for fraudulent behavior. If
one employee is responsible for generating
invoices and approving their payment, or
adding new vendors to a company’s system
and then approving them, this creates
vulnerabilities for fraud. Organizations
should carefully scrutinize these roles
and consider adding a separate layer of
authentication.

It  is  worth  noting  that  organizations  should
always  be  cautions  when  developing  programs
to review employees for insider fraud risk. Legal
issues arise in monitoring employee behavior and
legal  counsel  of  a  business  or  institution  should
be  consulted  before  implementation  of  new  pol-
icies.  For  example,  monitoring  employee  use  of
social  media  may  raise  privacy  and  other  issues
on  which  a  lawyer  should  advise  the  business
or  government  agency  that  is  contemplating
a new policy.

Internal  misappropriation  can  be  the  work  of
low-level as well as higher rank employees. They
should  all  be  monitored  on  a  risk  basis,  and  the
risks  posed  by  senior-level  staff  should  not  be
ignored.  Often,  higher  ranking  staff  is  capable
of  inflicting  far  more  harm  on  a  business  than
employees at the lower levels.

Internal controls aimed at reducing insider fraud
do  not  necessarily  need  to  be  complicated.  Sim-

ple mechanisms like division of duties and “mak-
er-checker”  models  can  be  highly  effective  at
detecting  certain  types  of  fraud.  For  example,
one employee could be tasked with creating new
vendor  invoices  in  a  company’s  payment  sys-
tem,  and  another  employee  assigned  to  review
and approve.

One thing is certain. If no internal controls exist,
or if those that exist are not enforced, temptation
lures employees.

IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD
Identity  theft  is  a  giant  menace  of  the  21st  cen-
tury.  Often,  perpetrators  are  employees  of  busi-
nesses,  including  doctors’  offices,  government
agencies  and  financial  institutions.  The  goal  of
identity thieves is to uncover the identities of pri-
vate  individuals  in  order  to  obtain  the  numbers
and  other  characteristics  of  their  credit  cards,
place of employment, residences, children, family
members,  friends,  vehicles  and  other  personally
identifying information.

By  learning  a  person’s  personal  information,  an
identity thief can penetrate a bank account, use
their  credit  cards,  receive  government  benefits,
seek  a  tax  refund  in  someone  else’s  name  and
more.  There  are  various  red  flags  that  indicate
a  person  has  been  the  victim  of  identity  theft.
These include unusual activity in personal finan-
cial  accounts,  unknown  charges  on  credit  card
statements,  notification  by  a  tax  agency  that
more  than  one  tax  return  was  received  in  your
name, and other harrowing occurrences.

Defensive  measures  against  victimization  by  an
identity  thief  include  using  care  about  where
Personal  Identification  Numbers  (PIN)  on  credit
cards and ATM cards are written and monitoring
the volume of mail a person receives. A substantial
drop in mail may indicate that someone has sent
a  change-of-address  card  to  the  postal  authori-
ties in order to have access to and to read one’s
mail and determine a person’s bank accounts and

credit  cards,  and  to  delay  the  discovery  of  the
identity theft by the victim.

Identity  theft  and  identity  fraud  are  terms  used
to  refer  to  all  types  of  crime  in  which  someone
wrongfully  obtains  and  uses  another  person’s
personal  data  in  some  way  that  involves  fraud
or  deception,  typically  for  economic  gain.  With
enough  identifying  information  about  an  indi-
vidual,  a  criminal  can  take  over  the  individual’s
identity to conduct a wide range of crimes, such
as  false  applications  for  loans  and  credit  cards,
fraudulent  withdrawals  from  bank  accounts,  or
obtaining  other  goods,  services  or  privileges
which the criminal might be denied if he were to
use his real identity.

If the financial criminal takes steps to ensure that
bills for the falsely obtained credit cards, or bank
statements showing the unauthorized withdraw-
als, are sent to a physical or e-mail address other
than  the  victim’s,  the  victim  may  not  become
aware of what is happening until the criminal has
already  inflicted  substantial  damage  on  the  vic-
tim’s assets, credit and reputation.

OVERVIEW AND METHODS OF
IDENTITY THEFT
Identity theft is one of the fastest growing types
of  consumer  fraud  and  considered  one  of  the
leading threats to deposit accounts at banks and
other financial institutions. It can be perpetrated
by a wide variety of means, including some popu-
lar methods listed below:

•  Account takeover or account hijacking where
a fraudster captures a customer’s personal
information and uses it to take over a
financial account

•  New account fraud in which a fraudster

assumes the identity of a real person to open
a phony account

•  Collusion between the fraudster and
customer, or between fraudster and
employees of an organization

COMMON TECHNIQUES USED BY
IDENTITY THIEVES
Creating fake online identities. Fraudulent iden-
tities  play  a  significant  role  in  many  high  pro-
file  financial  fraud  crimes.  With  today’s  Internet
capabilities,  fraudsters  can  easily  create  new  or
fake  identities.  Utilizing  social  networks,  blogs,
forums, email accounts, domain creation, website
creation and various internet accesses, the fraud-
ster can create an entire false persona, including
name, address, telephone number, email address,
website,  etc.,  and  represent  it  as  real.  Once  this
basic  identity  is  created,  the  fraudster  can  file
for a sole proprietorship or set up a corporation
using the identifiers of the false persona.

The fraudster can then obtain a government tax
or  other  identification  number  for  the  business
and open a new bank account for it. From all the
information associated with this person and busi-
ness, it can appear to be a legitimate entity.

Social  engineering.  Fraudsters  also  engage  in
social  engineering  to  perpetrate  identity  theft.
Social  engineering  typically  refers  to  methods
and  techniques  used  to  manipulate  people  into
performing  actions  or  revealing  confidential
information in order to gather data, commit fraud
or gain access to computer systems or networks.
The  basic  tools  used  to  obtain  information  are

A CREDIT CARD SKIMMER INSTALLED AT AN ATM

simplistic and based on human nature. The roots
of social engineering reach back to the days of tra-
ditional ‘con’ men and leverage the same skills to
convince a victim to reveal sensitive information.

Leveraging technology. Fraudsters capitalize on
the  speed  and  anonymity  afforded  by  new  tech-
nologies to perpetrate identity theft and identity
fraud, including the following:

•  Using handheld skimmers and other devices

that lift account information when the
individual swipes his or her debit or credit
card at an ATM or point-of-sale location,
such as in a store

•  Getting people to disclose sensitive

personal data by sending them phony emails
(Phishing), text messages (Smishing) and
phone calls (Vishing)

•  Using malicious software to capture
and transmit personal information to
counterfeiters over the Internet (Malware)

•  Using peer-to-peer computer technology,
such as the kind found on music-sharing
sites, to search personal computers for
password files, account numbers and
other information

Internal fraud. Studies of crime data have shown
that  a  high  percentage  of  identity  theft  starts
with  the  theft  of  personal  data  by  an  organiza-
tion’s employee. This confluence of identity theft
and  employee  corruption  is  an  important  trend
for financial institutions and other business orga-
nizations  to  recognize  and  protect  against  with
appropriate fraud tools.

SYNTHETIC IDENTITY FRAUD
Synthetic  ID  fraud  is  one  of  the  fastest-grow-
ing  fraud  types,  impacting  both  individuals  and
financial  institutions.  In  synthetic  ID  fraud,  bits
and pieces of information from a real person are
mixed  with  invented  data  to  create  an  entirely
new identity.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

76

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

It  starts  with  a  real  tax  identification  number,
usually  belonging  to  a  child.  Because  it  belongs
to  a  real  person,  the  tax  ID  will  often  show  up
as  a  valid  number  in  credit  reporting  and  other
checks used by financial institutions.

Tax identification numbers belonging to children
are  preferred  because  children  typically  don’t
have much of a presence in the financial system.
They usually aren’t applying for accounts, check-
ing  their  credit  report  or  doing  other  activities
that might lead to detection. The fraudsters will
then create a fake name and other details around
this stolen identification number, including a real
address (usually a PO box or mail drop).

Using  this  new  identity,  criminals  now  have  sev-
eral  years  to  set  up  accounts,  establish  a  credit
history,  get  credit  cards  and  obtain  personal
loans.  Fraudsters  might  nurture  these  synthetic
IDs  for  years,  making  card  payments  and  ser-
vicing  loans,  to  increase  the  amount  of  credit
extended  to  them.  At  some  point,  they  will  max
out their credit cards and loans and disappear.

In  one  notable  recent  case,  a  fraud  ring  created
nearly  7,000  synthetic  IDs  and  used  them  to
obtain more than 25,000 credit cards, as well as
loans.  The  scheme  went  on  for  years,  and  ulti-
mately  led  to  more  than  $200  million  in  losses
from financial institutions.

Financial institutions are still struggling with how
to  manage  the  risks  of  this  form  of  fraud.  Like
some  forms  of  loan  fraud,  synthetic  ID  fraud  is
often  written  off  as  a  credit  loss,  and  never  rec-
ognized  as  a  criminal  incident.  This  misclassifi-
cation  reduces  the  likelihood  that  an  institution
will  build  controls  around  synthetic  ID  fraud,  or
report it appropriately to law enforcement.

Since  synthetic  IDs  usually  do  not  have  a  credit
history,  institutions  should  be  careful  and  con-
duct  thorough  due  diligence  when  dealing  with
so-called  “thin  file”  applicants.
Institutions
should also verify applicant information from one

than  one  source,  rather  than  relying  solely  on  a
credit report.

Issues with an applicant’s tax ID number can also
be a red flag. If the tax ID number does not match
the other information provided for the applicant,
or matches a different person, this can be an indi-
cator of synthetic ID fraud.

RED FLAGS OF IDENTITY THEFT
Due  to  the  prevalence  and  increasing  growth
of  identity  theft,  various  countries  have  pushed
financial  institutions  and  other  organizations  to
incorporate the following into their fraud surveil-
lance systems:

•  A layered approach that combines scanning
software with other monitoring tools to
proactively identify and defend against
identity theft

•  Improved authentication procedures,

including layers and token or biometric
authentication devices and procedures

•  Implementation of fraud detection software

to identify account takeover

Because so much fraud committed now involves
the illegal use of stolen customer or internal data,
laws and regulations concerning the safeguarding
of confidential customer data have been enacted
in  many  jurisdictions.  In  particular,  financial
institutions are often required to make their own
assessments  of  potential  red  flags  of  identity
theft within their processes or procedures and to
implement methods for detecting and preventing
these red flags.

For  example,  the  US  Federal  Trade  Commission
and  other  regulators  implemented  the  FACT  Act
in  2009,  which  established  key  red  flag  catego-
ries  and  specific  examples  indicative  of  identity
theft. These red flags are broadly applicable and
are consistent with identity theft red flags or sce-
narios identified by regulators in other countries.
The following are key red flags:

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

77

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

•  Alerts, notifications and warnings from a

credit reporting company:

 » A fraud alert on a credit report

 » A notice of credit freeze in response to a

request for a credit report

 » A notice of address discrepancy provided by

a credit reporting agency

 » A credit report indicating a pattern of

activity inconsistent with historic activity

 » An unusual number of recently established

credit relationships or

 » account closing(s) because of account

privilege abuse

•  Suspicious documents:

 » Identification that appears to be

altered or forged

 » The person presenting the identification
does not look like the photo or match the
physical description

 » Information on the identification differs

from what the person presenting is saying,
or does not match other information, such
as a signature card or previous signatures

 » An application looks like it has been altered,

forged or torn up and reassembled

•  Suspicious personal identifying

information:

 » Inconsistencies with other information, such
as an address that doesn’t match the credit
report; use of a social security number or
national identifier that does not match

 » An address, phone number, or other

personal information that has been used on
an account known to be fraudulent

 » A fake address, an address for a mail

drop or prison, an invalid phone number
or one that is associated with a pager or
answering service

 » A social security or other identifier number,
as well as address or phone number that has
been used by other people opening accounts

•  An applicant who cannot provide identifying

information beyond what is generally
available from a wallet or credit report,
such as a person who cannot answer a
challenge question

•  Suspicious account activity:

 » Soon after the organization is notified of a
change of address, requests are made for
new or additional credit cards or to add
users to an account.

 » A new account that is used in ways

associated with fraud. For example, the
customer does not make the first payment
or makes only an initial payment, or most of
the available credit is used for cash advances
or for purchases of merchandise, such
as jewelry or electronics, which is easily
converted to cash

 » Account usage patterns are different

from historical activity, such as sudden
non-payment or increase in the use of
available credit

 » Mailed statement is returned as

undeliverable, or the customer reports
that he or she is not receiving the account
statements in the mail

 » Customer reports unauthorized charges

on the account

•  Notice from other sources, such as reports

from a customer, a victim of an identity theft
or law enforcement authorities

The  following  are  signs  of  identity  theft  that  an
individual should be on the alert for:

•  Certain mail, particularly financial
statements and bills, is no longer
being delivered

•  Unfamiliar charges on bank statements

•  Calls from collection agencies about

•  Decline of medical benefits because you have

•  A signature that is not yours on distinct

applications

INTERPLAY OF IDENTITY THEFT WITH
OTHER TYPES OF FRAUD
Government  benefits  fraud.  The  commonality
in  government  benefits  fraud  is  often  identity
theft  or  the  willingness  on  the  part  of  someone
to fraudulently provide their identity toward gov-
ernment benefits fraud, often for a small percent-
age or fee. A sophisticated thief may take the time
to  alter  supporting  identity  documents,  such  as
a  driver’s  license,  to  make  sure  that  everything
matches on the fraudulent application he submits.

Medicare  fraud.  Typically,  this  involves  one  or
more stolen identities which are then used to bill
a government program, such as Medicare in the
US. This type of fraud can be conducted using a
shell company with a P.O. Box address that is rep-
resented  as  the  “clinic”  where  treatment  is  pro-
vided.  The  perpetrators  use  stolen  identities  to
process fraudulent claims.

Student  loan  application  fraud.  Identity  thieves
or willing accomplices take a fee for applying as
“straw  students”  (in  countries  that  provide  pro-
grams supporting loans to college students). This
allows the fraudster to accumulate large amounts
of  financial  aid  from  student  loan  applications.
This  type  of  fraud  can  be  especially  successful
because,  generally,  the  loans  do  not  have  to  be
repaid  until  after  the  student  completes  college.
It  can  take  a  few  years  for  the  lender  to  realize
that the borrower is not repaying the loan.

Veteran  disability  benefits.  In  the  US  and  other
countries  where  military  service  veteran’s  bene-

fits are plentiful, collusion between veterans and
employees  of  the  pertinent  government  agency
can  perpetrate  veteran’s  benefits  fraud.  The
government  employees  have  easy  access  to  the
qualifying persons they need to recruit, such as
veterans who would qualify for benefits but have
no need for them. They can be used to complete
fraudulent  applications.  The  employees  hold  the
threat of a fraudulent claim against the veterans
and  receive  a  portion  of  the  benefit.  Fraudulent
claims may also include misstatement of injury or
illness to qualify for a claim.

DETECTING AND
PREVENTING FRAUD
In  recent  years,  regulatory  expectations  around
fraud  detection  and  prevention  have  increased
substantially.  At  the  same  time,  due  to  easy
access  to  information  online  and  through  social
networks, institutions and businesses face grow-
ing  reputational  risks  from  fraud.  Consequently,
institutions  and  other  companies  and  organiza-
tions  are  focusing  more  now  on  implementing
effective governance, risk and compliance (GRC)
programs.  GRC  is  viewed  as  critical  to  address
and correct organizational weaknesses that lead
to  significant  operational  risk,  losses  or  regu-
latory action.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

79

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

For  many  companies  and  institutions,  fraud  is  a
key  risk  to  profitability  and  reputation.  Imple-
menting effective fraud detection, prevention and
security systems has become a critical part of an
organization’s  ability  to  control  operational  risk.
Integrating  fraud  detection  and  prevention  into
the  organization’s  overall  GRC  framework  can
produce  substantial  benefit,  including  a  better
understanding  of  the  impact  of  financial  crime
on the organization, improving return on risk and
compliance  investments,  enhancing  the  organi-
zation’s reputation and cultivating customer trust.

FRAUD RISK ASSESSMENT AND RATING
Conducting  a  fraud  risk  assessment  (FRA)  is  an
essential  step  in  the  process  of  detecting  and
designing controls to prevent the specific types of
fraud the organization faces. The FRA can be con-
ducted by internal or external auditors or consul-
tants, or through some combination. It does not
necessarily  identify  exactly  the  types  of  fraud
occurring in the organization. Instead, it focuses
detection  efforts  on  specific  fraud  schemes  and
scenarios that could occur, as well as on incidents
that have occurred in the past. This information
enables  the  organization’s  risk  management  and
audit teams to make recommendations to senior
management and support the implementation of
fraud  prevention  controls  designed  for  the  iden-
tified risks and vulnerabilities.

Following are the steps that normally accompany
a comprehensive fraud risk assessment:

Create a ‘fraud risk assessment’ team. The FRA
team should include senior internal audit and risk
management  personnel  or  an  experienced  out-
side certified fraud examiner or consultant with
experience in conducting FRAs. According to the
Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision,  the
internal audit plan should be based on a method-
ical  control  risk  assessment  that  documents  the
organization’s  significant  activities  and  their
associated  risks,  as  well  as  the  principles  of  the
risk assessment methodology.

Identify the organization’s universe of potential
risks.  Determine  the  fraud  schemes  and  scenar-
ios  that  typically  affect  the  institution  or  orga-
nization, or firms like it. Assess the potential for
these schemes and scenarios based on past inci-
dents  of  fraud,  the  culture  of  the  organization
and its current framework of internal controls.

Most  FRAs  focus  on  identifying  fraud  risk  in  six
key categories:

•  Fraudulent financial reporting

•  Misappropriation of assets

•  Expenditures and liabilities for an

improper purpose

•  Revenue and assets obtained by fraud

•  Costs and expenses avoided by fraud

•  Financial misconduct by senior management

Analyze  the  likelihood  of  each  scheme  or  sce-
nario occurring. The FRA must consider not only
the possible risk, but the likelihood that a partic-
ular fraud will occur. International auditing stan-
dards specify four risk levels:

1.  Remote

2.  More than remote

3.  Reasonably possible

4.  Probable

Assess  the  materiality  of  risk.  The  FRA  team
should  identify  fraud  risks  that  could  have  an
important  financial  impact  on  the  organiza-
tion  and  its  stakeholders,  such  as  shareholders
and  lenders.  The  three  levels  of  materiality  are
inconsequential,  more  than  inconsequential  and
material.  Any  risks  that  are  deemed  more  than
inconsequential or material must be addressed by
gathering more detailed information or evidence
of potential fraudulent activity. This step should
take into account the risk tolerance of the firm.

Assess  risks  in  the  context  of  existing  anti-
fraud  controls.  The  FRA  team  should  evaluate
the  effectiveness  of  existing  controls  in  prevent-

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

ing the specific fraud scenarios which have been
identified  through  the  preceding  steps.  The  ulti-
mate objective of the fraud risk assessment is to
guide  the  organization’s  auditors  to  implement
specific measures to detect fraud, and senior risk
management  professionals  to  establish  or  adjust
anti-fraud controls to reduce the risk of fraud.

As  part  of  the  risk  assessment,  the  FRA  team
and the internal audit department must consider
whether  and  how  anti-fraud  controls  can  be  cir-
cumvented  or  overridden  by  management  and
others.  They  should  also  analyze  both  internal
and  external  threats  to  confidential  electronic
data and computer and network security.

FRAUD DETECTION IN CUSTOMER
ONBOARDING AND MONITORING
“New account” fraud is a significant challenge and
has become a main conduit for identity theft and
other  types  of  fraud.  Fraudsters  and  criminal
organizations  that  target  financial  institutions
take advantage of gaps in employee training and
communication and the pressures that front- line
employees typically face to provide good service
and bring in new accounts.

A  good  Customer  Identification  Program  (CIP)
can  do  far  more  than  satisfy  regulatory  require-

BASEL COMMITTEE ON
BANKING SUPERVISION
The  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Super-
vision  (BCBS)  is  a  committee  of  banking
supervisory  authorities  that  was  estab-
lished by the central bank governors of the
Group of Ten countries in 1974. It provides
a  forum  for  regular  cooperation  on  bank-
ing supervisory matters. Its objective is to
enhance understanding of key supervisory
issues  and  improve  the  quality  of  banking
supervision  worldwide.  The  Committee
also  frames  guidelines  and  standards  in
different areas - some of the better known
among  them  are  the  international  stan-
dards on capital adequacy, the Core Princi-
ples for Effective Banking Supervision and
the  Concordat  on  Cross-Border  Banking
Supervision.

The  Basel  Committee  formulates  broad
supervisory standards and guidelines, and
recommends  statements  of  best  practice
in  banking  supervision  (such  as  the  “Basel
III Accord”, for example) in the expectation
that member authorities and other nations’
authorities  will  take  steps  to  implement
them  through  their  own  national  systems,
whether in statutory form or otherwise.

ments associated with an anti-money laundering
compliance  program.  It  can  also  assist  the  firm
in reducing or preventing fraud by improving the
ability  of  the  firm’s  front-line  employees  to  ver-
ify whether application information is fraudulent
for a customer opening a new account or seeking
to transact with the organization. Not only must
the credit side of the institution or organization
guard  against  fraud,  deposit  accounts  are  also
vulnerable to fraud.

A sound Know Your Customer/Customer Due Dil-
igence  (KYC/CDD)  program  includes  robust  cus-
tomer identification and account-opening proce-
dures, which allows the institution to determine
the true identity of each customer and to assess
the  risk  or  potential  risk  presented  by  the  cus-
tomer.  As  part  of  the  customer  onboarding  pro-
cess,  the  organization  should  perform  due  dili-
gence as follows:

•  Gather and verify customer identification

materials in paper documents and electronic
identity verification

•  Verify and authenticate the

customer’s identity

•  Screen the customer against national and

international sanctions lists and other watch
lists, such as known or suspected fraud lists
from internal and external sources, including
law enforcement sources

•  Document the normal and expected business

activity for each customer, including
occupation and business operations

•  Document the customer’s relationship

within the organization and its subsidiaries,
including all the lines of business

Many  of  these  steps  also  apply  to  organizations
that  are  seeking  to  develop  or  strengthen  inter-
nal procedures to guard against signs of corrupt
activities  by  their  own  employees  or  through
third  parties  with  foreign  public  officials  and
their family and associates.

•  To prevent fraud, customer identification

should leverage third-party data and sources,
such as credit reports and other sources
of identifying information, to help validate
the information provided by the customer
or applicant:

•  Check if the customer or applicant has used

or is using more than one national identifying
number, a Social Security number in the US,
or other commonly used identifier typically
used for the purposes of identity verification.

•  Review an individual’s address

history relating to their national
identifying number or

•  Social Security number. Often, a fraudster

has numerous such numbers associated with
his or her identity.

•  Review how the person’ s surname, or family
name, appears in the credit report or other
third-party information compared to how the
name is spelled on the account or application
documents at the start of the relationship.

•  Check the usage of mail drop locations or
rental mailboxes, which could be a sign of
multiple or false identifications.

OVERVIEW OF FRAUD MONITORING AND
DETECTION SYSTEMS
Because of the volume of customers, transactions
and data involved in monitoring and surveillance,
as  well  as  evolving  fraud  trends  and  its  shifting
sands,  some  organizations  leverage  specialized
technology  to  help  meet  their  fraud  detection
and reporting requirements.

Data  Mining  Tools.  Data  mining  is  an  effective
and  widely  used  approach  for  discovering  and
detecting  fraud.  Data  mining  is  used  to  detect
patterns  of  activity  or  transactions  which  are
anomalous, or “stand out,” from typical customer
or business activity. It can also be used to discover
previously  unknown  relationships  between  cus-
tomers, accounts and entities transacting with or
through the firm or financial institution.

CHAPTER 4 • UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD

Suspicious  patterns  are  symptoms  of  fraud,  not
evidence  of  it.  Typically,  further  investigation
must  be  done  to  determine  whether  the  activ-
ity is actually fraud (or another form of financial
crime)  or  is  legitimate.  Therefore,  data  mining
tools  must  be  combined  with  other  capabilities
which  facilitate  the  review  and  investigation  of
the identified exceptions.

Data mining tools have evolved substantially and
are able to analyze much larger sets of data in a
much  faster  timeframe.  Data  mining  techniques
have  been  integrated  into  many  software  solu-
tions targeted at fraud detection.

Predictive  analytics.  Predictive  analytics  are
widely  used  in  fraud  detection  and  prevention
efforts.  Many  predictive  analytical  techniques
were  pioneered  by  the  credit  card  industry,  and
in  recent  years  have  been  leveraged  in  other
areas including payments, online banking access,
account  opening  and  small  business  fraud.  Like
data  mining  techniques,  predictive  analytical
models  have  been  integrated  into  many  fraud
detection software solutions.

Predictive analytics look at potential risk factors
to detect the likelihood of fraudulent activity and
develop  models  which  can  be  leveraged  for  real
time monitoring. For example, analytical models
evaluate transactions to identify subtle patterns
of  behavior  indicative  of  fraud,  or  activities  that
are  atypical  for  an  account  or  customer.  Fraud
analytical  models  are  an  excellent  complement
to  other  detection  techniques,  such  as  reports
or rule patterns (which detect known patterns of
fraudulent activity).

Analytic  modeling  provides  flexibility  because  it
allows successful automated detection of a broad
spectrum of suspicious activity, including activity
not previously recognized as fraudulent. Analyti-
cal models can also predict the likelihood or pro-
pensity  of  fraud  based  on  attributes  of  the  cus-
tomer  or  entity  seeking  to  do  business  with  the
firm  or  financial  institution,  and,  therefore,  are

an important part of the account and relationship
opening process.

including  financial

Point  fraud  detection  products.  Most  business
organizations,
institutions,
have invested in products and processes to iden-
tify  and  prevent  fraud  on  a  product  or  channel-
specific basis. Traditionally, they have focused on
employing “point solutions” which focus on a rel-
atively narrow scope of behavior or fraud.

Point solutions can be very effective for specific
problem  areas,  such  as  check  fraud  and  check
kiting,  ATM  fraud,  credit  card  fraud,  and  for
establishing  mechanisms  to  help  protect  access
through remote channels, such as online or mobile
banking  and  other  services.  Point  solutions  may
use one or a combination of fraud detection tech-
niques,  including  predictive  analytics  and  rule
patterns, to detect the specific type of fraud for
which the solution specializes.

Unfortunately,  fraudsters  do  not  stick  with  one
channel,  line  of  business  or  product.  Deploying
multiple  fraud  detection  solutions  does  not  sup-
port the ability to share and consolidate critical
information  among  fraud  detection  silos,  which
leaves the organization and its customers vulner-
able  to  more  sophisticated  fraud  schemes.  Each
of the major areas of fraudulent activity —activity
creating the most challenges for firms in terms of
losses,  customer  service  issues,  and  reputation —
typically  involve  more  than  one  type  of  mecha-
nism, channel or product.

Although  point  solutions  offer  significant  capa-
bilities  in  specific  areas  of  fraud,  they  can  gen-
erate high levels of “false positives” and may not
be well-integrated into the overall fraud and risk
management regime of the organization.

Fraudsters,  who  sometimes  associate  with  orga-
nized crime, often use smarter and more sophis-
ticated methods to gain access to financial data
in  an  organization.  Sometimes  collusion  among
merchants,  fraudsters  and  organization  insiders

exists.  For  this  reason,  many  organizations  have
implemented  enterprise-wide  fraud  detection
systems,  including  transaction  monitoring  and
case  management  systems  to  support  a  broader
view of fraud across various channels and types
of products and services.

Transaction  Monitoring  Systems.  This  is  an
automated  system,  either  a  proprietary  applica-
tion  or  vendor-provided,  for  ongoing  scanning
of  transaction,  customer  and  entity  data.  It  fil-
ters,  compiles  and  summarizes  transaction  data
and  flags  or  issues  alerts  on  situations  of  poten-
tially  suspicious  or  fraudulent  behavior.  Detec-
tion  is  typically  achieved  through  implementa-
tion  of  fraud  detection  scenarios  that  fall  into
three categories:

•  Rules-based scenarios which identify specific

patterns of behaviors related to fraud
typologies or red flags.

•  Statistical profiling scenarios which

identify unusual activity by modeling
typical or expected activity profiles for a
specific customer or type of customer and
identifying outliers.

•  Predictive analytical models which provide
automated detection of a broad spectrum
of suspicious activity, including activity
not previously recognized as fraudulent.
Analytical models can also predict the
likelihood or propensity of fraud.

Some  software  solutions  leverage  or  combine
multiple  types  of  approaches  to  help  improve
detection  capabilities.  In  addition,  most  transac-
tion  monitoring  systems  also  provide  alert  and
investigations  management  systems  to  facilitate
and  document  the  analysis  and  investigation  of
alerts  and  cases.  Comprehensive  alert  and  case
management can automate processes and reduce
investigative costs.

Enterprise case management built specifically for
financial crime investigators can provide a single
view of fraud, risk and compliance status. It can

help  prevent  and  reduce  losses  by  automatically
uncovering  and  focusing  investigations  on  the
most urgent and actionable alerts.

Internal reports. These are internally generated
reports  or  systems,  such  as  exception  reports,
incident reports and leads databases, which help
flag  activities  and  provide  important  ancillary
information  used  for  analyzing  or  investigating
alerts or cases.

Third  party  data.  These  can  be  reports,  online
research  portals  and  public  record  and  propri-
etary  data  sources  and  analytics  provided  by
third-party data vendors and repositories. These

BENFORD’S LAW
When hunting fraud in financial documents,
Benford’s  Law  can  be  a  useful  tool.  It  is  a
mathematical theory that says certain digits
appear  more  frequently  than  others  at  cer-
tain positions in real world data sets.

Benford researched all different sorts of data
sets- from the size of butterfly wings to the
surface area of rivers - and found the same
principle held true: The number 1 appears as
the first digit about 30% of the time, and the
number  9  appears  first  less  than  5%  of  the
time. The numbers 2 through 8 have different
probabilities of appearing as the first digit.

Benford’s  Law  applies  to  account  transac-
tions, bank transfers and wire transfers, and
can  be  used  in  investigations  and  foren-
sic accounting.

For  example,  an  investigator  might  analyze
a  company’s  financial  statements  and  note
that  the  number  9  is  the  first  digit  25%  of
the time. This will merit closer scrutiny and
could indicate fraud

may  include  credit  record  information,  as  well
as  more  sophisticated  predictive  analytics.  This
information  can  be  used  at  the  time  of  account
opening  for  Know  Your  Customer  and  due  dili-
gence purposes, and to support alert analysis and
investigations of suspicious or unusual activity.

THE IMPORTANCE OF AN
ENTERPRISE APPROACH TO FRAUD
AND FINANCIAL CRIME
In  their  efforts  to  more  successfully  man-
age  financial  crime  and  compliance,  business
organizations,  including  financial  services  enti-
ties,  often  recognize  the  need  to  take  an  enter-
prise-wide approach to fraud management. Many
of them, especially larger ones, are establishing or
have already established financial crime units or
financial intelligence units as a first step toward
targeting  fraud  in  a  more  comprehensive  way.
The effectiveness of this approach often depends
on  the  ability  to  bring  together  and  coordinate
existing point fraud detection software.

.A comprehensive fraud detection approach must
provide a single point of analysis for account and
customer  activity  and  also  enable  the  monitor-
ing  and  detection  of  complex  behavior  and  pat-
terns that may indicate broader issues. Exposing

events  as  they  are  happening,  particularly  more
complex,  cross-channel  fraud  schemes,  and  tak-
ing  action  before  assets  have  disappeared  are
critical  to  minimizing  losses  and  then  meeting
the challenging task of recovery.

A centralized approach that combines real-time or
near real-time fraud detection with sophisticated
analytics often facilitates early detection of fraud
schemes  and  their  participants  and  enhances
loss  prevention  and  mitigation.  An  organization
should  determine  what  the  recommendations
or  requirements  of  its  regulators  indicate  about
these approaches.

Establishing  an  enterprise  fraud  management
system, manual or automated, can be a key step
in better integrating fraud detection and preven-
tion  into  the  organization’s  overall  governance,
risk and compliance framework. This can provide
many benefits, including a better understanding
of the impact of financial crime on the organiza-
tion, and improved return on risk and compliance
investments, protection of the organization’s rep-
utation and maintenance of customer trust.

CHAPTER 4 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

Q 4-1. The CFO of a large public corporation sees that the company’s quarterly numbers
are going to exceed analysts’ expectations. Knowing the stock price will probably make
a  big  jump  when  this  news  is  released,  he  makes  several  large  open  stock  repurchases,
which increases the intrinsic value of the tens of thousands of shares he already owns.

He then mentions the earnings report to his wife, and she buys 1,000 shares of stock in her
personal trading account. Her broker, who knows that she is married to the CFO of this
company, feels that she must know something, so he recommends it to many of his clients
who buy some very large blocks.

The quarterly numbers are released, and the stock makes a big move as expected.  Which
individual in this scenario has committed insider trading?

GLOBAL
ANTI-CORRUPTION
COMPLIANCE
AND
ENFORCEMENT

OVERVIEW

Corruption  is  an  unfortunate  reality  throughout  the  world  in

developed and underdeveloped countries alike. It weakens and

undermines  democratic  institutions,  distorts  national  econ-

omies,  contaminates  business  practices,  fosters  government

instability, discourages external investments, unjustly enriches

public  officials  and  private  sector  business  people,  worsens

social conditions and public services, and impacts hundreds of

millions of people each day.

87

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

And  it  gives  corporations  an  unfair  competitive
advantage by buying government employees, and
props up poorly-run companies at the expense of
rivals unwilling to make corrupt payments.

by an employee of a regular government agency.
These  corrupt  acts  may  also  violate  other  crimi-
nal laws, such as those dealing with commercial
bribery, conspiracy, money laundering and others.

For  all  these  reasons,  corruption  and  its  many
deleterious  consequences  have  gained  great
public  and  international  attention  in  the  past
two decades.

Official  corruption,  which  refers  to  the  dishon-
est acts of public officials, can take many forms.
It can be bribery, extortion, embezzlement, kick-
backs, influence peddling, nepotism and alliances
with criminal elements.

This means that all public functions, especially in
countries where corruption is pervasive, may be
corroded and distorted to accommodate the cor-
rupt  interests  of  the  public  officials.  A  legislator
may  be  corrupted  to  advance  a  legislative  proj-
ect, conduct an investigation or kill a bill that is
pending in the legislative body. This corrupts the
laws that guide business and other dealings and
on  which  judicial  decisions  in  business  transac-
tions are based.

Official  corruption  is  not  limited  to  employees
in  the  executive  branch  of  government,  such  as
heads  of  state,  ministers,  law  enforcement  offi-
cials,  inspectors,  regulators  and  other  func-
tionaries.  Official  corruption  is  also  widespread
around  the  world  in  the  legislative  and  judicial
branches of government. In addition, many coun-
tries’  governments  create  state-owned  commer-
cial enterprises that compete with private sector
businesses that do the same things. These state-
owned  enterprises  engage  in  many  commercial
activities  typically  performed  by  private  sec-
tor entities.

State-owned  airlines  are  an  example.  They  fly
commercial  routes  alongside  private  sector  air
carriers  and  have  employees  that  perform  simi-
lar  jobs  as  those  in  private  airlines.  The  employ-
ees of these state-owned companies are as prone
to  corruption  as  those  of  standard  government
agencies.  In  general,  the  laws  of  most  countries
deem  corruption  by  persons  who  work  at  state-
owned entities in the same light as corruption by
employees of regular government agencies.

If an employee of a state-owned airline, for exam-
ple, seeks or obtains an unlawful payment for the
performance  of  an  official  act  related  to  the  air-
line, it is a corrupt act just as if it were performed

Similarly,  there  is  widespread  corruption  world-
wide  in  the  judicial  branch  of  government.  This
means judges who are sworn to impartiality and
fair dealings with parties that appear before them,
are corrupted by a party to rule in a certain way
or prohibit someone from taking action, or com-
pelling persons to do certain things. This goes to
the  heart  of  the  law  and  pollutes  the  legal  sys-
tem to the point where the public, whose tax dol-
lars support the system, loses confidence in the
courts and respect for the judiciary and the law.

Official  corruption,  which  is  often  called  public
corruption,  is  also  rampant  in  many  countries
where  organized  crime,  drug  traffickers  and
other criminal enterprises shower public officials
with money and expensive gifts to neutralize the
laws and their enforcement. This creates an envi-
ronment  in  which  the  more  traditional  financial
criminals  -  who  do  not  dirty  their  hands  with
drugs, human trafficking and the like - find public
officials more receptive to their corrupt payments.

THE WORLD MOVEMENT TO
COMBAT CORRUPTION
Recognizing this, major international bodies have
increased  international  pressure  on  nations  to
intensify  their  efforts  against  corruption  over

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

roughly the past 15 years. This has resulted in the
enactment of laws by various nations, notably the
United Kingdom, which enacted its far- reaching
Bribery Act in 2010.

In  addition,  this  surge  in  international  attention
to corruption has caused other nations to amend
their  laws  and  step  up  their  enforcement  activ-
ity.  The  notable  example  is  the  US,  which  has
greatly  increased  the  enforcement  and  regula-
tory efforts under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act.  The  FCPA,  which  became  law  in  1977,  is  the
grandfather  of  such  laws  around  the  world  that
prohibit and criminalize corrupt payments to for-
eign public officials.

The  new
international  standards  that  have
evolved  from  these  accelerated  and  intensified
efforts  have  served  as  a  beacon  for  nations  that
wish  to  improve  their  mechanisms  to  prevent,
deter  and  prosecute  corruption  in  their  govern-
ment functions.

NON-GOVERNMENTAL
ORGANIZATIONS AND ANTI-
CORRUPTION ADVOCACY
Non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs)  play  a
significant role in these efforts. They have raised
awareness of the effects of corruption, advocated
for  transparent  government  and  business  prac-
tices,  and  created  and  assisted  anti-corruption
monitoring efforts.

In the anti-corruption field, NGOs may be divided
into two groups:

1.  Those that are associated with or supported

by governments, sometimes through
international bodies like the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development

2.  Those that are non-profit entities that are

not officially supported by or connected to
a government

The  two  types  of  NGOs  often  engage  in  similar
work  and  partner  with  each  another,  thus  blur-
ring  the  distinctions.  Typically,  however,  NGOs
connected to national or international bodies are
more  active  in  creating  and  promoting  anti-cor-
ruption policies and standards, while unaffiliated
non-profit  agencies  normally  focus  on  anti-cor-
ruption advocacy.

One  of  the  best-known  of  the  unaffiliated  enti-
ties  is  Transparency  International  (TI),  which  is
headquartered  in  Germany  and  has  chapters  in
100  countries.  The  chapters  have  considerable
latitude to choose the projects they will pursue.

TI’s  anti-corruption  work  is  wide-ranging,  but
some  of  its  most  important  work  is  its  research,
analysis and reporting on corruption issues. TI is
one  of  the  key  sources  of  information  on  global
corruption,  which  is  facilitated  by  the  data  it
receives from its network of chapters. One signif-
icant TI publication is the Corruption Perceptions
Index, an annual report that assigns rankings to
all  countries  based  on  their  “perceived  levels  of

corruption,  as  determined  by  assessments  and
opinion surveys.”

There are thousands of non-profit entities world-
wide  that  are  dedicated  in  whole  or  in  part  to
anti-corruption advocacy, monitoring and public
policy.  Sometimes,  these  groups  have  urged  law
enforcement  agencies  to  investigate  and  bring

suit  led  French  authorities  to  seize  $250  million
in property owned or controlled by the dictator’s
son,  including  luxury  cars,  real  estate,  art  and
other valuables located in France.

Many nations, such as the US, have laws that per-
mit the seizure and confiscation of the assets of
corrupt  foreign  figures  and  the  sharing  of  the
proceeds of these cases with the nation that was
victimized by the corruption.

A recent example occurred in France. Three pri-

a  significant  role  in  fostering  and  strengthening
international  anti-corruption  policies.  It  does
this  primarily  through  its  Anti-Bribery  Conven-
tion, which has the official title of the Convention
on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials
in  International  Business  Transactions.  The  con-
vention  requires  signatory  countries  to  enact
laws  that  criminalize  bribery  of  foreign  public
officials,  such  as  the  US  Foreign  Corrupt  Prac-
tices Act (FCPA) does.

The  convention  also  commits  signatory  nations
to  a  two-stage  review  by  other  signatory  coun-
tries  on  their  anti-corruption  laws,  policies  and
enforcement  and  regulatory  resources.  In  the
first stage, the examining nation reviews the laws
to ensure they are complete and in keeping with
the  mandates  of  the  Convention.  The  second
phase assesses how well the nation is implement-
ing and enforcing its laws and how often its agen-
cies bring cases.

As  of  January  2019,  40  nations  had  signed  the
Convention,  including  Bulgaria,  Iceland,  New
Zealand,  Colombia,  France,  Germany,  the  US,
the  UK,  Brazil  and  Turkey.  The  Convention  has
prompted nations to amend corruption laws that
predate the Convention, including the US, which
amended the FCPA in 1998 to bring it in line with
the Convention’s requirements.

World Bank. One of the most visible and import-
ant NGOs, it is an international financial institu-
tion  that  extends  loans  and  financing  to  devel-
oping  countries.  One  of  its  primary  goals  is  to
reduce  poverty  by  encouraging  international
trade  and  investment.  Projects  funded  by  the
World Bank are often the targets of corrupt prac-
tices  among  the  nations  that  receive  assistance
and  the  contractors  and  service  providers  that
implement them. As a result, over the past decade,
the  Bank  has  actively  developed  and  promoted
anti-corruption  and  good  governance  programs.
Many  of  them  provide  training,  technical  assis-
tance  and  technology  to  recipient  nations  with
the  goal  of  improving  management,  administra-

ernment agencies.

In partnership with the United Nations Office on
Drugs  and  Crime,  the  World  Bank  also  adminis-
ters  the  Stolen  Asset  Recovery  Initiative,  known
as  StAR.  The  program  is  intended  to  “support
international  efforts  to  end  safe  havens  for  cor-
rupt  funds”  and  help  countries  that  lose  funds
and  other  resources  because  of  corruption  to
recover the stolen assets.

StAR  also  trains  personnel  of  law  enforcement
agencies  and  other  government  agencies,  as
well  as  private  sector  entities  on  asset  recovery.
It  produces  reports,  handbooks  and  guides  on
asset recovery.

United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime
(UNODC). The UNODC maintains an open source
database  of  corruption-related  legal  cases  and
information,  called  Tools  and  Resources  for

UNODC  provides  training  on  anti-corruption
enforcement  and  good  governance  practices  to
government  agencies  and  other  NGOs  through
numerous  publications  and  training  documents,
as well as its International Anti-Corruption Acad-
emy located in Austria. It also conducts research
on  corruption  and  produces  country-  specific
reports on corruption risks.

trols  directed  at  official  corruption  and  mecha-
nisms. By the end of 2012, it had been signed by
140  nations.  Signatory  nations  commit  to  crimi-
nalize  bribery,  implement  laws  and  regulations
intended  to  prevent  corruption,  and  cooperate
on asset recovery in corruption cases. Signatory
nations  may  seek  and  obtain  the  assistance  of
other signatories to combat corruption.

There are other prominent private sector organi-
zations that render valuable services to the world
community on the combat of official and private
sector corruption. These include Global Witness,
which  was  formed  in  1993  to  combat  corrup-
tion, natural resource exploitation, human rights
abuses  and  poverty;  and  the  Group  of  States
Against Corruption, which is a dependency of the
Council of Europe and monitors implementation
of  multilateral  agreements  that  seek  to  com-
bat corruption.

These  international  bodies,  NGOs  and  other
organizations  around  the  world  offer  informa-
tion,  training  resources  and  expertise  that  can
be  a  very  valuable  resource  for  financial  institu-
tions,  commercial  entities  and  national,  provin-
cial  and  local  governments  in  their  compliance,
investigation  and  enforcement  efforts.  Finan-
cial  crime  specialists  should  always  keep  these
resources in mind.

MECHANISMS THAT
FACILITATE CORRUPTION
Throughout the world, there is a wide variety of
mechanisms and vehicles that facilitate the plan-
ning and execution of corruption.

Here  is  a  listing  of  some  common  vehicles  for
corruption. Additional information on how these
can  be  applied  can  be  found  in  the  money  laun-
dering section.

Charitable  and  non-profit  organizations.  -  Non-
profit  organizations  and  donations  to  charities
represent  popular  corruption  vehicles.  A  cor-

rupt official may ask that a payment be made to
a  non-profit  entity  which  he  or  she  controls  or
benefits from.

STOLEN ASSET RECOVERY
INITIATIVE (STAR)
Assets  stolen  by  corrupt  leaders  at  the
country  level  are  frequently  of  stagger-
ing  magnitude.  The  true  cost  of  corrup-
tion far exceeds the value of assets stolen
by  the  leaders  of  countries.  This  would
include  the  degradation  of  public  institu-
tions,  especially  those  involved  in  public
financial management and financial sector
governance, the weakening if not destruc-
tion of the private investment climate, and
the  corruption  of  social  service  delivery
mechanisms  for  basic  health  and  educa-
tion programs, with a particularly adverse
impact  on  the  poor.  This  “collateral  dam-
age,”  in  terms  of  foregone  growth  and
poverty  alleviation,  will  be  proportional
to  the  duration  of  the  tenure  of  the  cor-
rupt leaders.

Addressing the problem of stolen assets is
an immense challenge. Even though coun-

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

In guidance on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
the US Department of Justice lists five questions
to consider when making charitable payments in
a foreign country:

•  What is the purpose of the payment?

•  Is the payment consistent with the company’s

internal guidelines on charitable giving?

•  Is the payment at the request of a

foreign official?

•  Is the foreign official associated with the

charity, and if so, can they make decisions
impacting your business?

•  Is the payment conditioned upon receiving

businesses or other benefits?

Political campaigns. Elected public officials have
political  organizations  through  which  corrupt
payments  may  be  made.  The  official  may  also
use a nominee or ‘front’ to create a company that
provides services to the campaign and which may
serve as a vehicle for corrupt payments.

Fictitious  employees.  A  corporation  or  other
organization can falsely increase its payrolls with
fictitious employees in order to disguise evidence
of corrupt payments. It could also convey bribes
by issuing checks to employees that have already
left  the  company,  or  by  directly  adding  govern-
ment  officials,  their  family  members  or  their
associates  to  the  company  payrolls.  A  company
could  also  corruptly  provide  services  to  govern-
ment officials by loaning employees to a political
campaign while it continues to pay their salaries.

Financial  crime  specialists  investigating  corrup-
tion should carefully scrutinize the checks issued
to  company  employees  to  determine  if  employ-
ees on payroll are still working for the company
and  if  they  appear  to  be  qualified  for  their  posi-
tion and salary.

Fictitious businesses. A corrupt official may sub-
mit invoices for nonexistent services in the name
of a shell corporation that he or she controls. Due

diligence  on  businesses  that  receive  payments
may  reveal  fictitious  businesses  that  are  corrup-
tion vehicles.

Payments  through  loans.  An  organization  or
individual  could  use  loans  to  disguise  corrupt
payments  in  several  ways.  A  payer  could  give  a
bribe to the recipient directly, but then record it
as  a  legitimate  loan  in  its  books  and  records.  A
company  or  individual  could  also  give  an  actual
loan  to  a  government  official  or  entity,  but  pro-
vide  it  on  very  favorable  terms,  such  as  at  a  low
interest rate if not interest-free.

Gifts, travel, entertainment and other personal
expenses.  These  are  often  a  cover  for  corrupt
dealings with a public official and his family and
associates. For example, a public official who asks
a business person for financial assistance to pay
his  daughter’s  college  education  may  be  seeking
a  bribe.  Companies  that  provide  an  official  the
free use of their apartments, cars or airplanes, in
effect, may be bribing that official.

Alternately,  a  company  might  pay  a  government
official  directly,  then  record  payments  in  its
books  and  records  as  fictitious  gifts,  travel  and
entertainment expenses. This is one reason why
strong  policies  on  expense  documentation  and
record-keeping are important in the anti-corrup-
tion context.

This does not mean that any funds spent on gifts,
travel and entertainment are illegitimate or ques-
tionable,  but  companies  should  exercise  caution
and  avoid  anything  approaching  lavish  expendi-
tures on government officials. Some examples of
improper  travel  and  entertainment,  provided  by
the US Department of Justice and based on real-
world cases, include:

•  A $12,000 birthday trip for a government

official from Mexico that included trips to
wineries and expensive dinners

•  A trip to Italy provided to eight Iraqi officials
that consisted mainly of sightseeing and

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

included $1,000 in spending money given to
each government official

•  $10,000 spent on dinners, drinks and

entertainment for government officials

OTHER CONDUITS FOR CORRUPTION
In  addition  to  those  vehicles,  there  are  numer-
ous other conduits to execute corrupt payments.
Here is a listing of some common conduits:

Offshore accounts in third countries held in the
names of nominees or family members

•  Third parties or nominees that front for

corrupt officials

•  Shell companies and trusts in offshore

secrecy havens

•  Nominees or “bagmen” to hide the identity of

the true beneficial owners

•  Gatekeepers, such as lawyers and notaries,

who create corporations, open bank
accounts, transfer proceeds, purchase
property, courier cash and perform
other services

•  Diplomatic pouches carried by foreign

service officers that are protected from
search or seizure

•  Embassy bank accounts maintained by a
country’s embassies in other countries,
which may be available for use by public
officials of the embassy’s home country

•  Correspondent accounts maintained in other
countries by the financial institutions of the
country where the corrupt official resides

•  Using state-owned companies that are

commercial entities owned by a government,
which may offer facilities and personnel to
execute a corrupt scheme

Corruption breeds other financial crimes. Often it
is part of larger financial crimes. To hide evidence
of their corruption, officials that take bribes and
companies that pay them usually falsify their tax

returns and fraudulently alter books and records.
One financial crime begets another and another.

THE UNITED STATES FOREIGN
CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT
The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) has
several  distinctive  features  that  deserve  expla-
nation  and  analysis  because  they  teach  many
lessons,  even  though  it  is  a  US  law.  The  FCPA  is
the  world’s  oldest  and  most  frequently  enforced
anti-corruption law and it can punish companies
worldwide for violating it. Understanding its pro-
visions  is  necessary  for  financial  crime  profes-
sionals in all countries.

Another reason why attention to the US and Brit-
ish anti-corruption laws is important is because
their global enforcement touches on private sector
organizations, business people and professionals.

The  roots  of  the  FCPA  can  be  traced  back  more
than  three  decades.  In  the  mid-1970s,  a  series
of  corporate  bribery  scandals  made  headlines
worldwide  and  triggered  unprecedented  gov-
ernment  scrutiny  of  transnational  corrupt  busi-
ness practices.

Investigations  of  international  corporate  brib-
ery  began  in  the  US,  when  the  political  scandal
known  as  ‘Watergate’  led  to  a  wider  probe  of
domestic  corporate  corruption.  These  inquiries
unearthed  evidence  not  only  of  illegal  political
contributions inside the US, but also widespread

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

bribery  of  non-US  public  officials  by  US  compa-
nies overseas.

One  example  involved  Lockheed  Martin  Corpo-
ration.  An  investigation  in  1975  by  a  US  Senate
subcommittee  exposed  that  the  US  aerospace
company  had  paid  $22  million  to  high-ranking
government  officials  in  four  countries  to  secure
airplane  contracts.  The  fallout  was  global.  In
Italy,  the  scandal  forced  the  sitting  president  to
resign.  In  the  Netherlands,  evidence  implicating
the  country’s  prince  taking  corrupt  payments
disgraced  the  royal  family.  Japan’s  prime  minis-
ter  was  arrested  and  convicted  on  charges  con-
nected to his accepting bribes.

The  US  SEC  subsequently  found  evidence  impli-
cating  more  than  400  US  corporations  that  had
paid $300 million in bribes to non-US public offi-
cials and political entities. The resulting outcry in
the  US  and  abroad  led  the  US  Congress  to  pass
the FCPA. It was enacted into law in 1977.

KEY PROVISIONS OF THE FCPA
The FCPA is a sweeping anti-corruption law that
has  criminal  and  civil  provisions.  It  makes  it  a
crime  for  US  individuals  and  entities,  including
corporations  and  non-profit  organizations,  to
“corruptly  offer,  promise  or  provide  anything  of
value to a foreign official for the purpose of obtain-
ing or retaining business.” The term “foreign offi-
cial”  has  been  interpreted  very  broadly  by  US
law enforcement and regulatory agencies. It has
come to mean not just elected officeholders, but
also political appointees and virtually all employ-
ees of a state agency or state-owned company.

The  FCPA  also  imposes  record-keeping  and
accounting  duties  on  certain  entities.  These  are
known as the “books and records” provisions and
are enforced by the SEC. The provisions require
companies  to  create  effective  controls  that  are
designed to prevent and detect corrupt payments.
Companies that violate these provisions can face
civil penalties.

The  FCPA  also  applies  to  non-US  persons  who
reside in the US and to non-US entities that are
registered  with  the  SEC  as  an  “issuer”  of  securi-
ties, meaning any company whose stocks or secu-
rities are traded on US exchanges. Even a non-US
company  with  no  offices,  employees  or  physical
presence in the US may be criminally prosecuted
in US courts for bribery it committed anywhere in
the world. This makes it a truly international law.

In  a  prosecution  for  violation  of  the  FCPA,  viola-
tors may face the judicial precept known as “will-
ful blindness.” This means that persons or entities
that  may  not  have  direct  knowledge  of  corrupt
payments  may  still  be  held  responsible  if  they
were  “willfully  blind”  to  the  payments  and  delib-

PDVSA BRIBERY SCANDAL
In  early  2018,  the  US  Department  of  Jus-
tice  released  the  opening  salvo  in  what
would  become  a  broad  campaign  against
corruption  tied  to  Venezuela’s  state-
owned  oil  company,  Petroleos  de  Venezu-
ela S.A (PDVSA).

US  prosecutors  indicted  five  former  offi-
cials  of  PDVSA  for  accepting  tens  of  mil-
lions  in  bribes  to  steer  contracts  to  two
US-based  businessmen.  As  the  officials
were  not  US  persons,  some  were  outside
the scope of the FCPA, but still subject to
US  money  laundering  laws.  Four  of  the
officials  were  arrested  in  Spain,  while  a
fifth was at large as of early 2019.

In  a  separate  case  later  in  the  year,  pros-
ecutors  in  Miami  indicted  a  US  citizen
and  former  German  banker  for  their  role
in embezzling $1.2 billion from PDVSA. In
that  instance  as  well,  prosecutors  com-
bined  corruption  and  money  laundering
charges, showing a clear connection.

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

ILLEGAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE FCPA
A  bribe  or  corrupt  payment  may  be  “anything
of  value.”  A  bribe  can  just  as  easily  be  conveyed
by  a  gift  of  expensive  luxury  goods,  lavish  trips
to  a  high-end  resort,  contributions  to  a  charity,
the hiring of a public official’s relatives or associ-
ates. The illegal payments need not be briefcases
full of cash.

Not only may other laws come to play in a foreign
corrupt  practices  case,  many  of  the  same  red
flags and techniques that are used to detect and
investigate other financial crimes may be applied
to foreign corruption cases.

For conviction, the FCPA requires that a payment,
gift or offer of payment must be made with “cor-
rupt  intent.”  One  way  to  demonstrate  that  is  by
showing  that  payments  were  intentionally  con-
cealed or disguised through off-the-books trans-
actions  or  non-transparent  payment  schemes.
Corrupt intent may also be shown if the payment
was  used  to  convince  a  foreign  official  to  abuse
his or her position.

Under the FCPA, corrupt payments do not have to
be actually made to violate the act. A conspiracy
to make corrupt payments to a foreign official is
also a violation of the FCPA, even if no payment is
actually made.

DEFINING A ‘FOREIGN OFFICIAL’
UNDER THE FCPA
The  FCPA  has  an  open-ended  definition  of  who
can  be  considered  a  government  official.  It  pro-
hibits  corrupt  payments  to  any  “foreign,”  or
non-US,  official  of  a  “government  or  any  depart-
ment,  agency  or  instrumentality.”  Unfortunately,
it does not define these terms.

This  language  has  given  the  US  Department  of
Justice  and  SEC  the  latitude  to  institute  FCPA
actions against a wide range of entities and actors.
In  recent  years,  the  US  has  successfully  prose-

erately avoided knowledge of the facts. The will-
ful blindness precept also applies in money laun-
dering  cases  where  a  person  alleges  that  he  or
she did not know of the illicit origin of the funds
involved in a transaction.

Non-US companies are justified to be concerned
about  FCPA  enforcement  by  the  US  Depart-
ment  of  Justice  and  the  SEC.  Nine  of  the  10
largest  penalties  for  FCPA  violations  have  been
imposed  on  non-US  companies,  including  enti-
ties  based  in  Germany,  France,  Japan,  the  Neth-
erlands and the UK.

The  FCPA  covers  only  payments  to  foreign  gov-
ernment officials, and not bribes or other corrupt
payments  to  private  companies  or  individuals,
which are normally classified as commercial brib-
ery. In addition, the FCPA covers only the makers
of corrupt payments, and not the recipients. For-
eign officials who accept corrupt payments may
not be prosecuted under the FCPA.

However, this has not prevented US enforcement
agencies  from  using  other  laws,  such  as  the  US
money  laundering  laws,  to  pursue  foreign  offi-
cials.  In  this  respect,  the  FCPA  intersects  with
other  laws,  such  as  those  dealing  with  money
laundering,  conspiracy  and  international  travel
for the purpose of committing corrupt acts.

cuted  corporations  and  individuals  for  bribing
officials in national, state and local governments,
as  well  as  regulators,  law  enforcement  agents,
political parties and their candidates.

Another  important  term  in  the  FCPA  is  “instru-
mentality.”  US  agencies  have  interpreted  it  to
include  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  such  as
utility companies, airlines and other state- owned
businesses. FCPA cases have involved employees
of  SOEs,  including  managers  of  so-  called  sover-
eign wealth funds, directors of a telecommunica-
tions utility and medical professionals employed
by  state-run  healthcare  systems.  State-owned
enterprises  are  very  common  in  many  nations,
and,  in  some  nations,  they  have  a  monopoly  or
near-monopoly on industry sectors such as trans-
portation, energy production and infrastructure,
and health care systems.

FPCA  cases  have  also  involved  companies  and
individuals for corrupt payments to employees of
entities  that  are  not  wholly-owned  by  a  foreign
government.  US  agencies  have  determined  that
foreign companies or entities can be considered
an  “instrumentality  if  a  foreign  government  has
a  controlling  interest  or  otherwise  exerts  con-
trol over them.”

In  November  2012,  the  US  Department  of  Jus-
tice  and  the  SEC  issued  guidance  to  the  public
on  compliance  with  the  Act  and  best  practices
in meeting the duties it imposes. They indicated
they  would  most  likely  not  pursue  an  enforce-
ment  action  against  an  enterprise  in  which  a
foreign  government  held  less  than  a  50  percent
ownership stake.

These  expansive  interpretations  of  “foreign  offi-
cial” and “instrumentality” have been challenged,
but no US court has limited the broad approach
of these government agencies.

THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY UNDER FCPA
Companies and individuals that operate overseas
frequently  employ  third  parties  for  a  variety  of

business  tasks,  including  marketing  and  distrib-
uting new products, providing legal consultation,
and  acting  as  intermediaries  between  the  com-
pany  and  government  officials.  Common  exam-
ples of these intermediaries are attorneys, sales
agents,  distributors,  consultants,  accountants
and lobbyists.

Third  parties  in  the  setting  of  possible  foreign
corrupt acts are some of the biggest compliance
and  liability  risks  that  a  business  organization
can  face.  The  FCPA  guidance  by  the  US  Justice
Department and SEC devotes considerable atten-
tion to third parties and the liability that can flow
from their actions.

Many  companies  have  faced  FCPA  enforcement
actions  as  a  result  of  corrupt  payments  made
by  third  parties.  One  high-profile  situation  that
erupted in mid-2012 involved Wal-Mart’s Mexican
subsidiary,  Wal-Mart  de  Mexico.  An  investiga-
tion and report by the New York Times revealed
that Wal-Mart de Mexico had retained attorneys,
known as “gestores,” to help obtain permits from
federal, state and local government agencies. The
attorneys  were  said  to  have  made  widespread
payments  to  Mexican  government  officials.  Wal-
Mart is under investigation by the Justice Depart-
ment and SEC and has launched a broad internal
investigation.

Middlemen who assist companies in dealing with
governmental  agencies  are  fixtures  of  the  busi-
ness  environment  worldwide.  Carefully  vetting
and monitoring of the third parties that are hired
is  essential  to  avoiding  FCPA  violations.  Experts
say  the  anti-corruption  compliance  measures
that  companies  and  individuals  should  take
when  employing  third  parties  should  include
the following:

1.  Thorough reviews of the third party’s

background, reputation and experience,
paying special attention to their connections
with government officials. Abnormally high
fees charged by them can be a red flag of
corrupt payments.

97

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

2.  Contract terms that explicitly describe all
services to be performed, and the fees or
expenses that are expected to be charged
and incurred. Contracts should include
warranties that formally commit the third
party to complying with the FCPA and other
anti-corruption standards.

3.  Continuous oversight and monitoring of

third parties after a contract is signed, to
include periodic updating of the review of
the third party, requirement of ongoing anti-
corruption training, and annual certification
that the third party is compliant with the
FCPA and local laws.

4.  The due diligence procedures exercised on
third parties should be risk-based, taking
into account the geographic area, past
history and the business rationale for hiring
them and other factors.

RED FLAGS OF CORRUPTION IN THIRD-
PARTY PAYMENTS
A  financial  crime  specialist  who  is  reviewing  a
company’s  compliance  program  or  investigat-

ing  a  corruption  case  should  be  aware  that  con-
tracts,  payments  and  business  arrangements
with  third  parties  are  common  mechanisms  for
corrupt payments.

In some cases, third parties may be paying bribes
on  a  company’s  behalf  without  the  knowledge
or  authorization  of  the  company.  In  other  cases,
companies may seek out third parties in order to
facilitate  or  obscure  bribe  payments,  or  ignore
evidence  that  third  parties  are  making  corrupt
payments on their behalf.

In these situations, various red flags such as the
following  may  be  used  to  indicate  that  a  third
party may be involved in a corruption scheme:

•  Fees that are much higher than other

third parties in the same sector, without a
compelling business rationale

•  Requests for abnormal or strange

compensation arrangements, such
as excessive commissions or unusual
reimbursements

•  Requests that payments for services be made

to offshore accounts

•  Third parties who have little experience in

the field they purportedly work in

•  Vaguely worded invoices from third parties or
that do not describe the services rendered

•  Close ties or past associations with

government officials

•  Third parties who seek to enter into a

business arrangement at the request of a
government official

•  The use of shell companies to conduct
transactions, or third parties that are
themselves a shell company

OTHER METHODS OF CONCEALING
CORRUPT PAYMENTS
There are a range of mechanisms to conceal cor-
ruption  and  the  related  payments.  The  few  rep-
resentative examples listed here are intended to
underscore  the  diversity  of  corrupt  payments,
not to serve as an exhaustive list.

Spotting  evidence  of  corrupt  payments  involves
more than simply checking off a list of red flags.
It relies on a careful examination of whether pay-
ments  or  transactions  have  a  convincing  ratio-
nale  that  fits  the  underlying  business  arrange-
ment,  and  whether  they  are  transparently  and
accurately documented.

Many  concealment  methods  are  seen  and
exploited in other financial crimes, which empha-
sizes  the  close  ties  between  corruption,  fraud,
money  laundering  and  tax  evasion.  The  same
investigative techniques employed in other finan-
cial  crime  cases  may  be  used  to  detect  corrupt
payments and deeds.

Bribe payers and recipients are tirelessly creative
in  designing  strategies  to  conceal  corrupt  pay-
ments,  and  financial  crime  professionals  should
be  equally  creative  in  identifying  and  flush-
ing them out.

SUCCESSOR LIABILITY
A company that purchases or merges with a com-
pany overseas should be concerned about liability
for FCPA violations under the concept known as
“successor  liability.”  This  means  that  if  Company
A acquires, merges or enters into a joint venture
with  Company  B,  Company  A  may  be  held  liable
for the prior FCPA violations of Company B.

Successor  liability  has  emerged  as  a  large  FCPA
risk  for  multinational  corporations.  One  of  the
largest FCPA penalties of all time was $579 million
imposed  against  the  US corporation Halliburton
in  2009.  This  arose  from  corrupt  payments  to
Nigerian officials that were made by Halliburton’s
foreign partner in a joint venture.

Conducting due diligence on a company prior to
engaging in a merger and acquisition or joint ven-
ture can be essential to avoiding liability. Pre-ac-
quisition  or  pre-venture  due  diligence  should
include  a  thorough  review  of  a  company’s  finan-
cial records and documents to look for evidence
of present or past corrupt payments. The due dil-
igence procedures should look closely at records
that  reflect  travel,  gifts  and  entertainment
expenses,  payments  to  third  parties,  and  sales
records showing high sales or large commissions
paid to salespersons overseas.

These  reviews  should  take  into  account  risk  fac-
tors  such  as  the  characteristics  of  the  country,
where the company operates and its relationship
or ties with foreign governments. A company that
operates  in  a  country  where  bribes  and  corrup-
tion are culturally acceptable, as is often the case
in  the  high-risk  industries  of  oil  and  gas,  would
clearly require more extensive due diligence than
one in a traditionally low-corruption jurisdiction.

Pre-acquisition  due  diligence  should  also  exam-
ine a company’s anti-corruption compliance pro-
grams  to  assess  soundness  and  identify  weak-
nesses.  Compliance  programs  will  depend  on
the type of business and level of risk but should
include  at  least  annual  employee  training,  docu-

mented anti-corruption policies and procedures,
certification  of  third  parties,  and  a  mechanism
to report suspected bribery and anti-corruption
legal violations.

When  an  acquisition  is  completed,  the  two  com-
panies  should  integrate  their  compliance  pro-
grams  and  ensure  they  are  consistent  across  all
offices,  branches  or  subsidiaries.  This  includes
providing consistent and adequate training to all

employees  as  soon  as  possible  after  a  merger  or
acquisition.  The  importance  of  providing  train-
ing  to  employees  of  newly  acquired  companies
in  mergers  and  acquisitions  is  continually  high-
lighted  by  US  enforcement  agencies,  who  stress
that  it  should  happen  within  a  short  timeframe
once the acquisition is complete.

BOOKS AND RECORDS
PROVISIONS OF THE FCPA

CASE STUDY: US V. CHIQUITA BRANDS INTERNATIONAL, 2007
In  a  historic  2007  case  of  bribery  and  corruption,  Chiquita  Brands  International,  a  multinational
corporation and one of the world’s largest banana producers at the time, was convicted of engaging
in a transaction with a terrorist organization. Chiquita was the first major US company to face a
conviction of this kind.

Chiquita’s  Colombian  subsidiary,  C.I.  Bananos  de  Exportacion,  S.A.,  or  “Banadex,”  was  the  com-
pany’s most profitable banana-producing operation. The case revealed that Banadex gave at least
$1.7 million in 100 separate payments to a Colombian terrorist group, the Autodefensas Unidas de
Colombia or the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), from 1997 to 2004. The company
also made payments to another terrorist organization, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colom-
bia, or FARC. Both were violent paramilitary organizations known to kidnap and murder civilians to
further their agendas.

AUC was labeled a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) by the US Secretary of State in 2001 and a
Specially-Designated  Global  Terrorist  in  2003.  These  designations  made  it  illegal  for  US  entities
to enter into business with or otherwise support the AUCFrom 1989-1997, Banadex paid FARC for
rights to grow bananas in a region of Colombia. In 1997, the leader of the AUC met with the general
manager of Banadex and explained his intentions to remove FARC from power and institute AUC
as the ruling group in the area. The AUC leader threatened the general manager, saying that harm
would  come  to  Banadex  personnel  and  property  if  he  did  not  provide  regular  payments  to  AUC.
Banadex paid AUC regularly until 2004.

It was revealed in the case that at least 10 top executives knew about and approved the illegal activ-
ities. Chiquita even received counsel about this predicament and was very strongly advised to stop
payments. The company ignored the legal advice and continued to produce bananas in the terror-
ist-controlled regions.

After  three  years  of  investigations  and  legal  proceedings,  Chiquita  pleaded  guilty  to  making  $1.7
million in illegal payments to designated terrorist groups. The company was fined $25 million and
agreed  to  adopt  a  large-scale  corporate  integrity  program  in  the  case  settlement.  Although  the
Department of Justice considered individual prosecution of Chiquita executives, none was pursued.

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

The  bribery  provision  is  the  most  widely  known
and  historically  the  most  aggressively  enforced
element  of  the  FCPA.  However,  the  law  contains
a  ‘books  and  records’  provision  that  creates  its
own  anti-corruption  compliance  duties,  with
stiff  penalties  for  corporations  and  individuals
that violate it.

As previously mentioned, the books and records
provision  is  enforced  by  the  SEC,  and  applies
only to entities who are registered as “issuers” of
securities with the SEC. This includes US and for-
eign corporations whose stocks, bonds and other
investment  devices  are  traded  on  US  exchanges.
The  provision  requires  such  issuers  to  “make
and  keep  books,  records,  and  accounts,  which,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the issuer.”

Legal professionals and FCPA advisors sometimes
joke  that  this  provision  requires  companies  that
make  corrupt  payments  to  accurately  record
them as such in their books and records. In prac-
tice,  the  books  and  records  provision  frequently
comes into effect in FCPA cases because compa-
nies or individuals who make bribes or other cor-
rupt  payments  rarely,  if  ever,  accurately  record
them in their accounts.

As  a  result,  a  company  or  individual  that  vio-
lates the FCPA’s bribery provision very often vio-
lates  the  books  and  records  provision  as  well.  A
defense  contractor  that  authorizes  a  consultant
to pay a $100,000 bribe to a government minister
to secure weapons contracts, and then disguises
the  expense  as  “consulting  fees”  in  its  accounts,
has violated the books and records provision and,
consequently, faces the civil fines and other pen-
alties the SEC can impose.

The  provision  also  requires  issuers  to  “devise
and  maintain  a  system  of  internal  accounting
controls  sufficient  to  provide  reasonable  assur-
ances”  that  transactions  are  conducted  with
proper oversight from a company’s management.

TOP 10 LARGEST
FCPA PENALTIES
Fines, civil penalties, disgorgement & inter-
est ranging into the nine-figure  amounts
are  not  uncommon.  Below  were  the  10
largest cases as of early 2018:

•  Telia Company AB (Sweden): $965

million in 2017

•  Siemens (Germany): $800

million in 2008
VimpelCom (The Netherlands): $795
million in 2016
Alstom (France): $772 million in 2014

•  KBR/Halliburton (US): $579

million in 2009

•  Teva Pharmaceutical (Israel): $519

million in 2016

•  Keppel Offshore & Marine (Singapore):

$422 million in 2017

•  Och-Ziff (US): $412 million in 2016

•  BAE (UK): $400 million in 2010

This  includes  management  oversight  of  the  exe-
cution  of  transactions  and  access  to  an  issuer’s
assets  only  with  management  authorization.  It
also requires issuers to ensure that transactions
are  recorded  in  a  manner  that  allows  financial
statements to be prepared according to ‘generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

GAAP is a set of standards used at US companies
and issuers that govern how financial statements
should  be  prepared,  presented  and  reported.
While it is not necessary to delve into these stan-
dards for the purposes of this manual, a financial
crime  professional  involved  in  FCPA  compliance
or  investigation  would  be  well  advised  to  have  a
general understanding of GAAP.

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

In the past, the SEC has played a secondary role in
enforcing  the  FCPA.  The  increased  enforcement
of  the  FCPA  over  the  past  decade  has  been  led
primarily  by  the  Justice  Department,  which  has
typically  launched  investigations  and  assessed
the  largest  monetary  penalties  in  settlements.
SEC  civil  fines  for  books  and  records  violations
were usually added to cases that were initiated by
the  Justice  Department,  and  focused  mainly  on
violations of the bribery provision.

In  recent  years,  that  trend  has  shifted,  and  the
SEC  has  begun  to  pursue  companies  for  violat-
ing  the  books  and  records  provision  even  when
they were not charged with violating the bribery
provision. Of the eight SEC enforcement actions
against corporations in 2012, four were civil cases
that  only  charged  books  and  records  violations.
The SEC collected more than $57.4 million in dis-
gorgements from those cases.

In total, the SEC collected $118 million from com-
panies in 2012 in FCPA cases. Financial crime pro-
fessionals  should  note  that  this  heightened  SEC
enforcement  increases  the  pressure  on  compa-
nies to implement robust accounting controls and
ensure adequate oversight by company directors.

CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES
UNDER THE FCPA
The  FCPA  imposes  substantial  criminal  and  civil
penalties.  One  recent  example  is  the  settlement
that  the  Swedish  telecommunications  corpora-
tion, Telia, reached with the Justice Department
and  SEC  for  bribery  of  government  officials  in
Uzbekistan  in  2017.  It  exceeded  $900  million  in
civil and criminal penalties.

Companies  that  violate  the  law’s  bribery  pro-
vision  face  criminal  fines  of  up  to  $2  million  per
violation, and civil penalties of up to $16,000 per
violation. Individuals who violate the anti- bribery
provision  face  criminal  fines  of  up  to  $250,000
per violation, civil penalties of up to $16,000, and
sentences of up to five years in prison.

Violations of the books and records provision also
carry significant penalties. For companies, violat-
ing the books and records provision can result in
a  criminal  fine  of  up  to  $25,000  and  a  civil  fine
of  up  to  $725,000  per  penalty.  For  individuals,
penalties  are  even  more  severe.  Individuals  face
criminal  fines  up  to  $5  million  and  civil  fines  of
up  to  $150,000,  as  well  as  prison  terms  as  long
as 20 years.

Instead of pursuing criminal cases, the US Justice
Department often employs Deferred Prosecution
Agreements  (DPA)  to  settle  FCPA  cases  against
companies.  This  usually  includes  monetary  pen-
alties and other remedial measures, but no crimi-
nal charges brought against the company or indi-
viduals.  The  terms  of  a  DPA  normally  include  a
criminal fine and assurances by the company that
it will not violate the FCPA again and will improve
its anti-corruption compliance program. Often a
company may be required to conduct a full audit
of its compliance program and submit a written
plan for augmenting it.

DPAs,  which  are  publicly  available  at  the  US  Jus-
tice Department’s website, serve as a resource for
financial  crime  specialists  who  seek  to  fashion
compliance programs and measures that reduce
the risk of FCPA violations.

The  cost  of  facing  an  enforcement  action  runs
beyond  the  penalties  and  the  remediation  pro-
cedures that may be imposed. At a multinational
corporation, such as Siemens, these reviews can
involve international teams of legal professionals,
investigators,  forensic  accountants  and  auditors,
in addition to internal staff that is distracted from
its normal work for long periods. Companies that
are  penalized  for  FCPA  violations  have  suffered
considerable declines in their stock price, as well
as  lawsuits  by  shareholders.  The  reputational
harm is also large.

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

FCPA AND ANTI-CORRUPTION
COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS
All  organizations  should  establish  systems  and
controls  to  detect  and  prevent  corrupt  pay-
ments.  This  is  known  as  anti-corruption  com-
pliance.  In  the  past  decade,  it  has  become  an
essential  responsibility  for  businesses  and  orga-
nizations worldwide.

Because of the increased attention to corruption
and  the  financial  malfeasance  of  public  officials
in  countries  that  have  suffered  through  difficult
economic times, anti-corruption compliance has
become  almost  an  essential  part  of  doing  busi-
ness. It extends beyond the FCPA.

The UK Bribery Act, like all other anti-corruption
laws  with  a  broad  reach,  also  generates  compli-
ance responsibilities. Most nations have national,
state and local, bribery and corruption laws that
must  also  be  recognized  and  factored  into  an
organization’s  anti-corruption  compliance  pro-
gram. These laws vary widely in scope, design and
penalty,  and  a  financial  crime  specialist  whose
responsibilities  include  anti-corruption  compli-
ance  is  well-advised  to  understand  the  laws  of
the jurisdiction in which they operate.

Private  business  entities  are  not  the  only  ones
that  must  consider  and  implement  anti-  cor-
ruption  compliance  programs.
International
non-profit  and  non-governmental  organizations,
which  often  operate  in  countries  where  corrup-
tion  is  widespread,  frequently  have  their  own
compliance and training programs.

Like  compliance  programs  in  other  financial
crime fields, such as anti-money laundering, anti-
corruption compliance should be tailored to the
organization, its operations and risk profile. Com-
pliance should start with a thorough risk assess-
ment, taking into account the geographic regions
in  which  it  operates,  its  products  and  services,
its relationships with corporations, third parties

and  other  entities  and  connections  to  govern-
ment agencies, officials or their family members
or  associates.  The  risk  assessment  should  also
examine  the  organization's  employees  and  their
respective  formal  or  informal  ties  to  govern-
ment officials.

KEY ELEMENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE ANTI-
CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
In  November  2012,  the  US  Justice  Department
and SEC issued a 120-page “Guidance on the US
Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act1.”  Financial  crime
specialists who work in the anti-corruption field
should  familiarize  themselves  with  the  entire
document,  which  is  available  on  the  website  of
the  US  Justice  Department.  A  link  is  included  in
the Appendix.

In  addition  to  this  guidance,  other  governments
as well as non-governmental organizations, have
issued  guidance  on  anti-corruption  compliance
programs.  In  2010,  the  UK's  Financial  Services
Authority  (which  became  the  Financial  Conduct
Authority in 2013), the principal financial industry
regulator in the UK, issued guidance on the Brib-
ery  Act  that  included  six  elements  of  success-
ful compliance.

Guidance by industry associations and nonprofit
organizations,  such  as  the  International  Cham-
ber  of  Commerce's  Rules  on  Combating  Corrup-
tion  and  Transparency  International's  Business
Principles for Countering Bribery, are also useful
resources for financial crime specialists.

The  US  Justice  Department  and  SEC  Guidance
included  several  “hallmarks”  of  an  FCPA  com-
pliance  program.  The  following  summary  is
intended  as  a  general  overview  of  these  hall-
marks,  incorporating  and  expanding  on  them
with  guidance  from  other  public  and  private-
sector organizations.

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

US  enforcement  agencies  say  they  take  the  ade-
quacy of compliance programs into account when
they make decisions concerning the initiation or
termination  of  enforcement  actions.  They  add
that  a  company  with  a  robust,  risk-based  com-
pliance  program  will  receive  “meaningful  credit”
if a violation occurs. This may include a decision
not to prosecute or pursue a civil action against
a company that has an effective compliance pro-
gram in place. That is called a “declination.”

The  Justice  Department  demonstrated  this  will-
ingness  to  decline  prosecution  in  a  case  involv-
ing  a  subsidiary  of  Morgan  Stanley  in  China.  A
Morgan  Stanley  employee  was  found  to  have
paid  several  million  dollars  to  a  Chinese  official
in  real  estate  deals  and  was  charged  with  FCPA
violations.  The  Justice  Department  announced
it  would  not  charge  Morgan  Stanley  because
the  company  had  a  well-documented  and  thor-
ough  compliance  program,  including  more  than
30 training sessions for the employee in question
over seven years.

Beyond risk assessment, other key elements of an
effective program include the following:

Commitment  from  senior  management  to
anti-corruption compliance. This has been found
repeatedly  as  a  recommended  best  practice  in
FCPA  enforcement  actions  and  in  the  guidance
from  the  UD  and  other  nations  with  anti-cor-
ruption  laws.  Commitment  from  top-level  man-
agement  can  include  both  words  and  actions
from an organization's directors. These measures
are  designed  to  explain  and  clarify  an  organiza-
tional  culture  in  which  bribery  and  corruption
are viewed as unacceptable, and compliance and
reporting of violations is encouraged.

Valuable  elements  of  the  expression  of  commit-
ment  by  senior  management  would  include  the
participation  of  senior  management  in  anti-cor-
ruption training programs, statements to employ-
ees expressing a no-tolerance policy for violations
of  the  compliance  program,  and  a  commitment

that  the  organization  will  avoid  doing  business
with  an  organization  or  entity  that  engages  in
corrupt activities.

Effective  procedures  for  risk  assessment  and
internal audit. Before an organization can imple-
ment policies and procedures to prevent corrup-
tion, it must first understand where the risks for
corruption  lie.  Procedures  to  assess  risk,  there-
fore,  form  a  bedrock  for  anti-corruption  com-
pliance.  There  are  several  steps  an  organization
should consider when conducting its risk assess-
ment. Assessing risk relies on many factors, and
the following ones should not be deemed to be an
exhaustive list.

•  Choosing and analyzing data. All

organizations rely on data to assess risks,
from financial reports and audit findings
to corruption indexes issued by non-
governmental groups. One of the first
steps in assessing risk is to determine what
data will be used and how they will be
organized, weighted and analyzed. For larger
multinational organizations in particular,
this can be a significant step that requires
considerable time and resources.

•  Determining key areas of risk. Before

drilling down on more specific risks, such as
in a certain service, third party or overseas
subsidiary, for example, it is helpful to
look at broad areas that might present
corruption risks.

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

This could include examining internal risks,
such as a lack of consistent training or
unclear gifts and entertainment policies. It
may also include assessing geographic risks
to determine if an organization operates in
a jurisdiction with weak anti-bribery laws or
enforcement, a widely recognized history of
commercial or governmental corruption, or
a culture in which gift-giving and bribery is
considered the norm. It should also examine
the risks in its existing partnerships to
determine if the partners are exposed or
prone to corruption through relationships
or contributions to public officials, political
parties or associations, charitable groups
or ventures.

•  Determining expertise. An accurate risk

assessment can be challenging based solely
on the knowledge and expertise that is
required to carry one out. An organization
must determine if it has the proper skills
among its employees and executives to
properly assess risk, and understand
what internal and external personnel and
expertise it needs or plans to use.

Clearly  articulated  compliance  policies,  proce-
dures  and  code  of  conduct.  This  encompasses
a  company's  documented  anti-corruption  com-
pliance  program  and  existing  procedures  to
implement  them.  Some  measures  could  include
the following:

•  A clear statement of commitment to adhering
to anti-corruption statutes and regulations,
including the FCPA, UK Bribery Act
and local laws.

•  Direction on how, when and in what amounts

employees are allowed to pay for gifts,
hospitality or entertainment for foreign
officials or their families and associates. This
includes procedures to ensure that payments
are legal and transparently recorded, and an
approval process exists for such expenses.

•  An explicit written statement prohibiting

bribery and corruption, possibly including a

no-tolerance policy for employee involvement
in corrupt activities.

•  Standards of behavior for the organization's

employees, which may include an anti-
corruption agreement written into
employment contracts.

•  Procedures on the actions that should be
taken if bribery or corruption is detected,
and a clear chain for escalating corruption
issues upward to senior management.

To build anti-corruption policies and procedures,
organizations  should  examine  pre-existing  com-
pliance programs in related fields, such as fraud
and  money  laundering.  It  is  possible  to  apply
certain  tools  from  other  compliance  regimes,
such as anonymous reporting telephone lines or
transaction  monitoring  systems,  to  anti-corrup-
tion programs.

An  organization  should  also  solicit  advice  and
suggestions  from  employees  when  it  is  creat-
ing  anti-corruption  procedures  and  policies.
Employees often have great expertise and on-the-
ground  experience  concerning  the  challenges
and  risks  of  corruption  settings  and  players.
Involving  employees  may  help  create  a  sense  of
ownership in the compliance program and assist
in building a compliance culture.

Compliance program oversight and monitoring
by senior management, autonomy and adequate
resources.  US  and  UK  agencies  make  clear  that
an  organization  should  designate  members  of
senior  management  to  supervise  the  anti-cor-
ruption  compliance  program.  These  persons
bear ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the
program is robust and effective, and should have
direct access to the top levels of authority in the
organization.  This  usually  includes  the  board  of
directors and the audit committee.

Senior  management  must  ensure  that  the  com-
pliance  program  has  adequate  resources  to
effectively  detect  and  prevent  corruption.  Such
resources  should  include  a  compliance  staff,

105

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

funding and tools, such as databases and transac-
tion monitoring systems. The resources may also
include  external  legal  counsel,  investigative  pro-
fessionals  or  technical  support  services.  Orga-
nizations  should  consider  their  risk  profile,  size
and  organizational  complexity,  and  the  services
or products they offer when they are determining
the resources that will be adequate to build and
maintain the compliance program.

Ongoing  training  for  employees  and  third  par-
ties.  Training  is  another  crucial  element  of  anti-
corruption  compliance.  It  should  include  the
provision  to  employees  and  third  parties  of  full
information on the relevant anti-corruption laws
and regulations in the jurisdiction where an orga-
nization  operates,  and  full  details  on  the  organi-
zation’s  anti-corruption  policies.  Comprehensive
direction  on  how  to  report  suspected  instances
of corruption must be included, via escalation to
higher authorities.

The  training  should  clearly  delineate  the  dis-
ciplinary  measures  that  will  be  taken  against
employees  who  violate  the  policies.  Many  orga-
nizations  require  termination  of  those  employ-
ees  and  notification  of  the  proper  authorities  of
possible criminal or civil violations. Some organi-
zations  have  implemented  measures  that  incent
proper  behavior,  such  as  employee  bonuses  for
commendable  adherence  to  the  anti-corrup-
tion policies.

Procedures  for  confidential  reporting  of  cor-
ruption violations and internal investigation. If
suspected bribery or corruption arises, organiza-
tions should have processes for employees at all
levels to report potential violations confidentially.
These  mechanisms  should  include  a  clear  chain
of  command  for  escalating  the  reports  upward
in  the  organization's  hierarchy,  and  appropriate
procedures  to  inform  regulatory  and  enforce-
ment  authorities,  where  appropriate.  Investiga-
tive  steps  should  be  documented  and  if  weak-
nesses  in  a  compliance  program  are  identified
during the investigation they should be corrected

and incorporated into an organization’s audit and
review of its program.

Updating compliance programs through testing
and review. An organization should audit its com-
pliance program on a periodic basis, as well as in
response to changing market conditions, service
or  product  offerings,  or  partnerships  and  busi-
ness  arrangements.  When  it  opens  a  new  office
overseas,  it  should  thoroughly  review  its  com-
pliance  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  they
are adequate for conditions and risks in the new
jurisdiction.

Organizations  must  also  take  into  account  any
changes to applicable laws and enforcement pol-
icies  in  all  countries  where  it  operates.  Periodic
review  and  updates  of  compliance  programs
should  include  how  the  review  results  will  be
reported,  to  whom  within  the  organization  the
report shall be given, and how and when the rec-
ommended changes shall be implemented.

Risk-based  due  diligence  on  third  parties  and
transactions. These include acquiring knowledge
of  the  third  party's  reputation  and  associations,
an  understanding  of  the  business  rationale  for
hiring  the  party  and  the  expected  services  the
party  is  expected  to  provide,  and  ongoing  moni-
toring and due diligence of the third party.

THE UK BRIBERY ACT
Like the FCPA, the Bribery Act of the UK stands as
an  anti-corruption  law  with  international  scope
and  broad  applicability  on  entities  that  are  sub-
ject  to  its  provisions.  In  many  ways,  the  Brib-
ery Act goes beyond the FCPA in the behavior it
prohibits, and the criminalization of commercial
bribery, in addition to bribery of government offi-
cials.  It  also  contains  fewer  exceptions  than  the
FCPA.  For  example,  it  prohibits  "facilitation  pay-
ments,"  whereas  the  FCPA  does  not.  The  Brib-
ery  Act  also  criminalizes  domestic  corruption
and  the  acceptance  of  bribes  by  UK  citizens.  In

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

KEY PROVISIONS OF THE UK BRIBERY ACT
The  Bribery  Act  contains  sections  that  create  a
blanket  "offense  of  bribing  another  person,"  and
a  prohibition  of  "bribery  of  foreign  officials."  In
addition, it makes it an offense to request, accept
or agree to accept a bribe. This is a crucial differ-
ence from the FCPA, which only covers the payers
or givers of bribes but not their recipients.

The offense of bribing another person is broadly
defined.  It  includes  bribes  given  or  promised  to
any person in a public or private capacity. It covers
any person who "offers, promises or gives a finan-
cial or other advantage…intending the advantage
to  induce  a  person  to  perform  improperly  or  to
reward a person for improperly performing…any
of the following functions or activities:"

•  "Any function of a public nature," which

includes duties and efforts undertaken by
government officials

•  “Any activity connected with a business”

•  “Any activity performed in the course of a

person’s employment”

•  “Any activity performed by or on behalf of a

corporation”

A bribe does not have to be conveyed in cash or
other tangible assets to be an offense under the
Bribery  Act.  Any  “financial  or  other  advantage”
may be deemed a bribe. This could include gifts
and  entertainment  expenses,  donations  to  char-
ities or even non-financial inducements, such as
favorable publicity.

As  the  law  states,  commercial  bribery,  or  bribes
given  by  one  employee  or  representative  of  a
corporation  to  another,  is  prohibited.  This  is  a
key  divergence  from  the  FCPA,  which  only  cov-
ers  bribes  given  or  promised  to  foreign  officials.
A  function  or  activity  can  also  be  considered
“improperly  performed”  if  someone  is  bribed  in
order  to  prevent  him  or  her  from  doing  some-
thing, rather than actively undertaking an action.

this manual, coverage of this law will focus on its
international provisions.

Legislation  to  strengthen  the  UK's  corruption
laws was first proposed in the early 1970s, but it
took  more  than  three  decades  of  parliamentary
debate  and  stalled  bills  before  the  Bribery  Act
was passed in 2010. The act replaced three previ-
ous British corruption laws, all almost a century
old,  which  had  been  criticized  as  outdated  and
inadequate  by  the  Organization  for  Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) during the
ratification  process  of  at  the  OECD's  Anti-Brib-
ery Convention.

Although it was widely recognized as a stringent
anti-corruption  measure  when  it  was  enacted,
enforcement under the law has been limited, with
only a handful of cases as of early 2018. The law
only  applies  to  offenses  committed  after  July  1,
2011, the date it became effective. In January 2017,
the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) brought one
of the most notable cases under the Bribery Act,
charging engineering firm Rolls-Royce with con-
spiracy  to  engage  in  corruption  and  failure  to
prevent bribery.

Rolls-Royce  entered  into  a  deferred  prosecution
agreement  and  paid  a  penalty  of  roughly  $800
million  to  the  SFO,  US  Justice  Department  and
Brazilian authorities in a global settlement.

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

Section  6  of  the  Act  explicitly  covers  bribery  of
foreign officials. Its operative provisions are simi-
lar to the FCPA and state that a person commits a
violation if they “offer, promise or give any finan-
cial or other advantage” to a foreign official or to
another person at the request of the official. The
offer of financial or other advantage must include
the following:

•  Be made to influence the foreign official in

their official capacity

•  Be intended to obtain business, retain

business or gain an advantage in the business

•  Not be permitted or expressly required

by the relevant written law in the foreign
official's jurisdiction

Unlike  the  FCPA,  bribery  of  a  foreign  official
under  the  UK  Bribery  Act  does  not  require  "cor-
rupt intent" on the part of a person paying a bribe.
As mentioned above, there is no "facilitation pay-
ment"  exemption.  Payments  to  speed  up  a  rou-
tine  government  function  are  considered  bribes
to a government official. Although this may be an
impediment  to  conducting  business  in  some  cir-
cumstances, many corporations and government
agencies  already  have  no-tolerance  bribery  poli-
cies that forbid facilitation payments.

Corrupt activities do not necessarily have to take
place in the UK to be subject to the Bribery Act.
A person or entity that pays a bribe could poten-
tially  still  be  prosecuted  even  if  the  entire  brib-
ery scheme occurred in a country outside the UK,
provided the briber or recipient had a "close con-
nection" to the UK. This includes British citizens,
corporations  formed  in  the  UK  and  individuals
who normally reside in the UK.

FAILURE TO PREVENT BRIBERY
Section 7 of the Bribery Act creates a standalone
offense  of  "failure  by  a  commercial  organization
to prevent bribery."

 The  law  casts  a  wide  net  on  what  may  be  con-
sidered  a  "commercial  organization."  It  broadly

defines  it  to  include  any  corporation  or  partner-
ship formed under UK law, as well as any corpo-
ration or partnership that "carries on business" in
any  part  of  the  UK.  "Commercial  organizations"
are  not  just  for-profit  companies.  Non-profit
organizations  and  charitable  foundations  are
also covered.

In guidance on the law that it issued, the UK Min-
istry of Justice indicated that it will ultimately be
up  to  the  courts  to  define  what  activities  count
as "carrying on business" in the UK. The Ministry
said it would use a "common sense approach" that
weighs if an organization had actual commercial
operations within the UK. According to the guid-
ance, an organization would automatically qualify
as "carrying on business" if it was traded on the
London Stock Exchange.

Under the Bribery Act, a commercial organization
may be held liable for failing to prevent bribery by
an "associated person," which can include a wide
range of contractors, agents and other third par-
ties operating on behalf of the organization. The
guidance states that the definition of "associated
person" was left open-ended in order to cover the
broad  range  of  other  companies  or  individuals
that could perform services for an organization.

Under the Bribery Act, organizations have a com-

with  [them]  from  bribing."  The  Bribery  Act  does
not specify what “adequate procedures” are.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK BRIBERY ACT
Although  the  Bribery  Act  exceeds  the  scope  of
the  FCPA  in  several  ways,  many  of  the  essential
compliance procedures and practices apply under
both  laws.  The  UK  guidance  lays  out  six  "princi-
ples" it says should form part of an organization's
compliance program. They are summarized here
for reference, but a financial crime specialist con-
ducting  a  project  or  investigation  related  to  the
Bribery Act should refer to the full guidance that
is included in the Appendix:

•  Proportionate Procedures. An organization
should adopt processes and controls to
prevent bribery that are proportionate to
the scale and complexity of its activities.
This principle stresses that all compliance
programs must be tailored to the specific
circumstances of the organization. The
guidance underscores that procedures must
be "clear, practical, accessible, effectively
implemented and enforced."

•  Top-Level Commitment. The guidance

recommends that the top management of
an organization, from CEO to the board
of directors, must have a demonstrated
commitment to preventing bribery, which
should be communicated to the entire
organization.

•  Risk Assessment. Organizations should
conduct a well-informed, documented
and regularly-updated risk assessment by
determining the nature and extent of its
possible external and internal corruption
risks. This risk assessment should include
third parties and other persons and entities
associated with the organization.

•  Due Diligence. Organizations should conduct
appropriate due diligence on all persons or
entities that perform services, including third
parties such as attorneys and sales agents,
based on their risks.

•  Communication (including training).

Organizations should use thorough internal
and external communication to ensure that
anti-corruption policies are recognized,
accessible and understood by all employees,
as well as third parties. This includes a
training program based and focused on the
corruption risks faced by an organization.

•  Monitoring and Review. The anti-corruption

compliance program of an organization
should undergo auditing and testing
regularly, especially after significant changes
to the organization's business lines, services
or operations, such as opening a new
affiliate overseas.

Financial crime specialists should understand and
be aware of how the UK Bribery Act differs from
the FCPA, including the absence of an exemption
for facilitation payments and the coverage of the
Bribery Act of all bribery, not just bribery of for-
eign officials.

UK BRIBERY ACT PENALTIES
Violations of the Bribery Act carry stiff penalties.
Individuals found guilty of violations face up to 10
years in prison and an unlimited fine. A “commer-
cial  organization”  found  guilty  of  failing  to  pre-
vent bribery also faces an unlimited fine.

Individuals  and  organizations  found  guilty  may
have  assets  confiscated  under  another  British
law, known as the Proceeds of Crime Act. A com-
pany director or senior manager who violates the
Bribery  Act  may  be  disqualified  from  serving  as
a director of any company or from taking part in
the formation or management of any company.

BRIBERY AND EXTORTION
Bribery and extortion have many characteristics
in  common,  and  the  lines  between  the  two  can
become blurred. There are key differences, how-
ever,  and  for  the  purposes  of  investigating  and

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 5 • GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT

preventing  corruption,  it  is  important  to  under-
stand their distinctions.

 Both  are  criminal  acts  that  involve  a  giver  pro-
viding  assets,  services  or  other  articles  of  value
to a recipient. One major difference between the
two  is  what  the  recipient  will  do  in  response  to
receiving  the  asset  or  article  of  value  from  the
giver.  In  bribery  scenarios,  a  giver  is  provid-
ing something of value in exchange for a benefit
offered by the recipient.

In  extortion,  the  recipient  is  typically  not  offer-
ing  to  provide  anything  of  benefit  to  the  giver.
Instead, he or she is threatening to take an action
or  engage  in  conduct  that  will  harm  the  giver  if
he  or  she  does  not  provide  something  of  value,
usually  of  a  specific  amount  or  to  comply  with
the  recipient’s  demands.  For  example,  a  com-
missioner of insurance may threaten to reject an

application for a license for an insurance company
if the applicant does not pay a certain amount to
his nominee.

Extortion  typically  involves  the  threat  of  harm
against  a  person  or  entity,  whereas  bribery
involves  the  offer  of  some  benefit  for  a  person
or entity. To be considered extortion, the threat
must be credible and the harm must be immedi-
ate and tangible.

Both  the  FCPA  and  UK  Bribery  Act  have  exemp-
tions to making corrupt payments if the payments
are made under real duress, and the company or
individual is in legitimate danger from a credible
threat. Even so, companies or individuals looking
to  remain  compliant  with  anti-  corruption  laws
such as the FCPA should understand that, in most
circumstances,  they  will  not  be  able  to  protect
themselves from liability by claiming extortion.

CHAPTER 5 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

Q 5-1. You are a compliance analyst at a multinational financial institution that provides
banking and investment services to large institutional customers. Your institution is cur-
rently seeking new business opportunities providing services to universities, hospitals and
other institutions with potential ties to political officials and government agencies. Your
institution plans to expand into Norway, India, Botswana and Chile and has asked you to
assess the corruption risks of offering its services in each nation.

What is an accurate risk rating for these countries?

A.  Providing investment and banking services in Norway poses the highest risk for
corruption due to a history of bribery by Norwegian state-owned oil companies.

B.  Providing services in India poses the highest risk for corruption due to the prevalence

of state-owned entities and Politically-Exposed Persons (PEPs).

C. Providing investment and banking services in Botswana poses the highest risk for

corruption due to widespread graft in government contracts.

D. Providing services in Chile poses the highest risk due to connections between the

Chilean government and international organized crime rings.

 TAX
EVASION
AND
ENFORCEMENT

OVERVIEW

There is an old adage that says that “the only things in life that

are certain are death and taxes.” While financial criminals may

not be able to cheat death, they certainly try, and mostly suc-

ceed, in evading their taxes. For obvious reasons, corrupt offi-

cials, money launderers, Ponzi schemers and others usually can-

not  declare  their  criminal  proceeds  on  their  tax  returns.  This

would threaten their criminal operation with exposure. Even if

they are able to make their criminal proceeds appear legitimate

for tax purposes, financial criminals who steal and cheat for a

living typically have few qualms about evading taxes.

112

As  a  result,  tax  evasion  is  a  constant  element  of
virtually  all  financial  crimes.  For  this  reason,
suspected  criminals  are  sometimes  charged
with  tax  evasion  when  there  is  insufficient  evi-
dence  to  accuse  them  of  the  criminal  activity
that  produced  the  money.  The  famous  gangster,
Al  Capone,  is  the  poster  child  and  most  famous
example of this law enforcement approach. It has
also  been  used  successfully  against  organized
crime  figures  in  the  US  and  Europe  for  several
decades,  and  continues  to  be  employed  against
money laundering masterminds, various types of
fraudsters, corrupt politicians and many others.

Tax  enforcement  procedures  and  capabilities
vary  greatly  from  nation  to  nation.  For  example,
the US Internal Revenue Service has a unit called
Criminal  Investigation,  which  is  notable  for  its
skill  pursuing  tax  evasion  by  US  citizens.  Some
jurisdictions lack the resources, capacity or polit-
ical will to seriously pursue tax enforcement.

TAX EVASION IS AN ELEMENT IN
VIRTUALLY ALL FINANCIAL CRIMES
In  addition  to  its  serving  as  a  vital  component
of  all  financial  crimes,  tax  evasion  is  a  financial
crime  in  its  own  right,  even  if  tax-evading  indi-
viduals or organizations derived their funds from
a legitimate source. In the financial crime arena,
tax evasion is a component or necessary step in
most other financial misdeeds, including corrup-
tion, fraud and money laundering.

Globally,  virtually  all  nations  have  enacted  laws
that criminalize tax evasion and related offenses,
such  as  conspiracy  to  commit  tax  fraud.  Finan-
cial  crime  specialists  who  perform  their  jobs  in
other nations should always be aware of the tax
ramifications of any financial crime that they are
investigating.

In recent years, starting in the wake of the 2008
global  financial  crisis,  national  governments,
starving  for  tax  revenues,  have  confronted  tax
evasion  more  aggressively.  This  has  produced  a

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

FIGURE 1 – An Image of Notorious Gangster Al
Capone Upon His Arrest in 1931. Capone Ran a Far-
Reaching Criminal Organization, but was Ultimately

growing  international  crackdown  on  all  types
of  tax  evasion,  domestic  or  through  overseas
accounts  and  entities.  One  sign  of  the  growing
recognition of tax evasion as a vital element of all
financial  crime  is  the  inclusion  by  the  Financial
Action  Task  Force  of  tax  evasion  as  a  predicate
offense  for  money  laundering  in  its  revised  40
Recommendations in 2012.

Along with many EU countries, the US has spear-
headed  this  tax  evasion  crackdown.  One  major
US  initiative  is  the  enactment  of  the  US  Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (FATCA). This
law requires all financial institutions outside the
US  to  report  the  existence  of  certain  accounts
held by US persons in their facilities. They must
report  this  information  to  the  Internal  Reve-
nue  Service,  the  US  government’s  tax  authority.
FATCA is not only a dramatic new global tax com-
pliance initiative, but it also has implications in all
fields of financial crime.

FATCA  has  led  many  nations  to  negotiate  and
sign  bilateral  agreements  with  the  US  fostering
cooperation and a greater exchange of tax infor-
mation on their respective citizens. Perhaps more
importantly, it has helped foster the adoption of a
multilateral  system  of  tax  information  exchange

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

113

created  by  the  OECD,  known  as  the  Common
Reporting  Standard.  This  will  be  discussed  in
more detail later in this chapter.

This chapter provides a general overview of what
tax  evasion  entails  and  the  avenues  and  mecha-
nisms through which it is conducted. It also cov-
ers  some  common  schemes  of  tax  evasion  and
key indicators that suggest tax fraud is occurring.
Additionally,  it  provides  guidance  on  conducting
investigations into tax evasion and using tax doc-
uments in financial crime investigations, generally.

Often,  tax  information  that  a  person  or  busi-
ness  organization  has  prepared  and  filed  can
be  a  critical  source  when  investigating  a  finan-
cial criminal or building a legal case against one.
Although  many  jurisdictions  have  tight  secrecy
laws restricting access to tax information, it can
be very valuable for a wide range of matters. All
financial  crime  professionals  should  have  famil-
iarity  with  tax  evasion  and  enforcement  issues.
Sometimes,  investigating  a  criminal  as  a  tax
evader can be a very effective step in unraveling
the larger financial crime scheme.

TAX EVASION VS. TAX AVOIDANCE
As a financial crime specialist, it is important to
distinguish between legal methods to reduce tax
liabilities  and  illegal  avenues  to  reduce  taxes  or
evade  paying  taxes.  It  is  common  among  tax-
payers  to  minimize  taxes  applicable  to  income
and other assets. The tax regimes of many juris-
dictions  recognize  legitimate  methods  to  min-
imize  or  remove  tax  consequences  for  certain
transactions,  but  uniformly  prohibit  and  punish
tax evasion.

However, not following applicable tax laws or uti-
lizing unlawful methods to escape taxation can be
a violation of law and subject the taxpayer to seri-
ous  penalties.  Generally,  many  courts  have  rec-
ognized that individual taxpayers may reduce the
amount  of  taxes  that  would  otherwise  be  appli-
cable if lawful means authorized by law are used.

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

•  Tax evasion is escaping payment of taxes by

illegal means, such as by hiding the true state
of one’s finances from tax authorities or not
filing required tax documents.

•  Tax avoidance is sometimes referred to as

tax mitigation and is the legal use of the tax
laws and regulations to one’s advantage to
reduce the taxes that are payable by means
that are approved by the law or regulations.
Some methods of tax mitigation are common,
such as making use of pension plans or
retirement accounts in the US that postpone
tax until retirement.

Although  governments  have  always  had  enforce-
ment  authority  over  illegal  tax  evasion,  recent
economic  downturns  and  reduced  public  reve-
nues have forced governments and taxing author-
ities to closely look at tax evasion methods and so
called  “aggressive”  tax  avoidance  in  an  effort  to
detect violators and increase tax revenue.

Other  terms  that  the  financial  crime  specialist
may need to know include the following:

•  Tax shelter is a mechanism by which a

taxpayer may protect assets or income from
taxation or at least delay the application
of taxes. Common forms of tax shelters
may include investments in pension plans
and real estate. It is important to note that
many types of tax shelters are completely
legal. Where tax shelters may cross the
line into tax evasion is when they are solely
designed for the purpose of avoiding taxes.
In these cases, they may be deemed abusive
by tax authorities and subject the pertinent
taxpayers to criminal or civil penalties.

•  Tax havens are jurisdictions that provide

secrecy or other means of protecting assets
placed there from being taxed by other
jurisdictions. Tax havens may be states,
countries or territories with low taxes
or no taxes at all. It is not uncommon for
corporations or individuals, usually high-
wealth individuals, to physically relocate

114

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

to these jurisdictions or shift assets there
by opening subsidiaries or shell companies.
As economies have become increasingly
globalized in recent years, this has led to
fears of tax competition among jurisdictions,
as nations compete to offer lower tax
burdens. Global tax compliance efforts, like
FATCA, are partly intended to stem such tax
competition.

There  is  no  one  universally  accepted  definition
of  a  tax  haven.  One  simple  definition  proposed
by  some  economists  is  a  jurisdiction  with  tax
laws  that  are  purposefully  designed  to  cater  to
individuals  and  corporations  looking  to  avoid
taxes.  Often,  these  jurisdictions  will  alter  their
laws  to  make  them  more  attractive  to  persons
and entities.

Additionally, many havens have bank secrecy and
data  privacy  laws  designed  to  severely  restrict
the tax information that may be shared with gov-
ernment  and  law  enforcement  agencies  in  other
jurisdictions. For this reason, tax havens are also
referred to as “secrecy havens.” Many havens also
have extradition laws or treaties that only permit
extradition  for  a  limited  number  of  crimes,  usu-
ally violent ones, and exempt financial crimes like
tax fraud from extradition.

One  useful  working  definition  of  tax  havens
comes  from  the  Government  Accountability
Office  (GAO),  the  US  Congressional  watchdog
agency.  In  a  December  2008  report  on  the  use
of  tax  havens  by  US  corporations,  the  GAO  pro-
vided the following characteristics as suggestive
of a tax haven:

•  No or nominal taxes.

•  Lack of effective exchange of tax information

with foreign tax authorities.

•  Lack of transparency in the operation of

legislative, legal or administrative processes,
particularly in functions such as the
formation of companies. ‘Secret rulings,’
negotiated tax rates and other practices

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

that fail to apply the law openly, fairly and
consistently are indicators of a lack of
transparency. Also contributing to a lack
of transparency are limited regulatory
oversight and enforcement powers, and
the government’s inability to access
financial records.

•  No requirement for a substantive local
presence, which allows individuals and
corporations to set up shell companies
and other entities without the need to be
physically located in the haven, sometimes
with nothing more than a PO Box.

•  Self-promotion as an offshore financial

center. Before more recent reforms, nations
such as the Cayman Islands and jurisdictions
such as Jersey and Guernsey, often
advertised their offshore financial services,
indirectly or directly, giving the impression
they were a tax haven.

INTERNATIONAL SCOPE
OF TAX EVASION
By nature, tax evasion is difficult to quantify. This
is  particularly  true  of  offshore  tax  evasion,  as
funds are often disguised by complex legal struc-
tures and hidden in tax haven accounts with little
transparency.

Estimates of the scope of tax evasion exist, how-
ever.  A  2012  report  by  anti-tax  evasion  advo-
cacy group, Tax Justice Network, estimated that
between US$21 trillion and US$32 trillion is kept
undisclosed to tax authorities in secrecy havens
worldwide.  This  represents  between  24  percent
and 32 percent of total global investments. In an
older  2007  estimate,  the  OECD  estimated  that
untaxed capital held offshore amounted to US$5
trillion  to  US$7  trillion,  or  approximately  6  to  8
percent of total global investments.

Some  rough  calculations  reveal  the  amounts  at
stake.  Taking  the  OECD’s  conservative  $7  tril-
lion number and assuming those untaxed assets

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

would earn just five percent each year, and these
earnings  would  be  subject  only  to  a  20  percent
tax rate, nations are losing $70 billion a year from
undisclosed  offshore  assets.  Some  estimates
are far higher.

Because  much  of  the  revenue  lost  from  tax  eva-
sion  is  in  more  developed  countries,  the  OECD
has taken a lead in developing international stan-
dards for transparency and exchange of informa-
tion concerning tax matters.

Tax  evasion.  In  broad  terms,  tax  evasion  or  tax
fraud is the willful violation of one’s legal duty to
pay  mandatory  taxes  to  the  government.  At  its
most basic level, tax evasion may be as simple as
misstating facts and numbers on a tax return, or
failing  to  file  a  required  form.  Other  straightfor-
ward examples include the following:

•  Underreporting of income

•  Overstating deductions and losses

•  Overstating dependents

•  Filing returns on behalf of another without

authorization (identity theft)

Tax evasion schemes can also be extraordinarily
complex,  involving  offshore  accounts  and  multi-
ple  layers  of  corporate  entities  and  legal  trusts
that  make  the  true  owner  of  assets  very  diffi-
cult to determine. While international efforts to
increase  transparency  and  the  exchange  of  tax
information  between  jurisdictions  have  made
strides  in  recent  years,  there  are  still  many  ave-
nues for the creative financial criminal to dodge
taxes and disguise assets.

A few of the more notable tax evasion and fraud
schemes  are  outlined  below.  Specific  varieties
of tax evasion depend heavily on the tax laws of
the  nation  or  jurisdiction  where  the  fraud  takes
place, and these laws can vary widely. As a result,
the financial crime specialist should be aware of
tax fraud schemes that are tailored to exploit the
laws of their jurisdiction.

The  advantages  of  tax  havens1  basically  may  be
classified in four categories:

Asset  holding.  The  first  step  of  asset  holding
involves  forming  a  corporation,  trust  or  other
legal  entity.  In  more  complex  arrangements,  a
trust  will  be  formed  that  controls  a  company.
Typically,  the  entity  will  be  formed  in  one  tax
haven and administered in another. The purpose
of the entity is to hold assets, which may include
physical  properties,  investments,  funds  or  other
companies. By transferring the control and own-
ership  of  such  assets  into  an  entity  in  a  haven,
the  assets  are  often  no  longer  able  to  be  taxed
in other jurisdictions. Asset holding is sometimes
done to avoid or evade a specific type of tax, such
as inheritance tax.

Trading and other business activity. To minimize
taxes, businesses that operate online or remotely,
or  require  only  minimal  staff,  will  sometimes
relocate  to  havens.  These  may  include  certain
investment  and  financial  services  companies,  as
well as technology groups. Historically, a key use
of  havens  for  corporations  attempting  to  mini-
mize taxes was in transfer pricing schemes.

Transfer pricing. This allows companies to shift
pre-tax  profits  and  losses  between  subsidiaries
and legal entities they control in order to reduce
their overall tax burden. In general, such schemes
are legal, although there are limitations on them
in  the  tax  laws  of  many  nations.  The  Organiza-
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD)  has  produced  guidelines  on  conducting
transfer pricing that many of its member nations
have  adopted,  but  the  practice  remains  contro-
versial.  Recently,  the  UK  has  indicated  that  fur-
ther international cooperation is needed to limit
what is characterized as transfer pricing abuses.

FALSIFYING DEDUCTIONS TO
UNDER-REPORT INCOME
Falsifying deductions in a tax return filed by a per-
son or business organization are a common way
to  evade  taxes.  Tax  laws  normally  allow  taxpay-
ers a wide range of deductions from their income.
Falsifying these deductions reduces taxes and is a
crime in most countries. Depending on a nation’s
tax laws, permissible deductions vary widely. For
example,  many  tax  laws  allow  deductions  for
medical  expenses,  which  can  include  payments
to doctors, dentists, surgeons, medical insurance,
prescription  drugs,  medical  devices  and  other
related  costs.  A  taxpayer  may  fabricate  false
receipts for these payments to reduce his taxes.

Another  way  to  falsify  medical  deductions  is  to
disguise  payments  for  non-deductible  medical
expenses,  such  as  the  cost  of  cosmetic  surgery,
by  making  it  appear  the  payments  were  for  nec-
essary medical surgery.

It is more difficult to fabricate receipts for deduct-
ible expenses for taxes paid to state or provincial
governments,  including  property  taxes  paid  on
real  estate  the  taxpayer  owns.  Tax  payments  to
these government agencies may be easily verified
by these agencies.

The  falsification  of  deductions  for  charitable
contributions  is  also  a  frequent  occurrence.  To
establish if the contributions were actually made,
receipts  for  the  purported  contributions  and
the  records  of  the  charitable  organization  must
be examined.

All  deductions  claimed  in  a  tax  return  are  now
more  susceptible  to  being  proved  or  disproved
by  the  electronic  data  that  virtually  all  financial
transactions  leave  behind,  including  those  per-
taining  to  tax  deductions  that  are  claimed.  The
electronic  records  of  taxpayers  and  of  the  orga-
nizations  and  agencies  that  are  subjects  of  sus-
pected  falsified  deductions  must  be  examined.
The skills of a computer forensics specialist should
sometimes be sought in these investigations.

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

SMUGGLING AND EVASION OF
CUSTOMS DUTY
Simply  put,  smuggling  is  moving  goods  or  prod-
ucts across national or jurisdictional boundaries
by covert means, without paying the required tax.
One of the oldest forms of tax evasion, smuggling
is  still  commonplace  in  many  jurisdictions  with
high  tariffs  or  customs  duties  on  imported  and
exported goods.

In  many  cases,  developing  nations  are  most  reli-
ant on customs duties, especially since they often
lack effective income taxes or enforcement or tax
structures, or they have low rates of compliance
with these taxes. Two common forms of evasion
of  customs  duties  are  through  under-invoicing
and misdeclaration of an import. These schemes
are intended to misrepresent the type or quantity
of  a  product  that  is  in  international  commerce
in order to falsely lower the tax or duty required.
Misdeclaration,  or  claiming  that  an  import  or
export is a different type of product, is often used
when there are high customs duties on a certain
type of product, such as tobacco goods.

Gross  valuation  overstatement.  As  the  name
implies,  this  involves  inflating  the  value  of  prop-
erty,  assets  or  services  above  the  correct  value
when that value of property or service is used to
claim a deduction or tax credit.

EVASION OF VALUE ADDED TAX
(VAT) AND SALES TAXES
With  the  notable  exception  of  the  US,  the  value
added tax (VAT) is a common type of tax globally.
It is charged and collected on the consumption of
goods and usually levied in place of sales tax. VAT
is  charged  by  the  seller  to  the  buyer  of  an  item,
which  means  that  typically,  producers  of  goods
collect  VAT  from  the  consumers.  This  allows
producers to evade VAT by underreporting their
amount of sales.

To  prevent  their  residents  from  going  to  other
jurisdictions to avoid VAT, most jurisdictions that

use VAT also legally mandate residents to report
and  pay  the  tax  on  items  purchased  in  another
jurisdiction. This can be difficult and resource-in-
tensive  to  enforce.  Consequently,  most  nations
target  VAT  enforcement  efforts  at  luxury  items
and other high-cost goods.

Carousel Fraud. This is a variety of tax fraud that
goes by several names, including “missing trader”
fraud.  It  exploits  the  mechanism  for  collecting
VAT in order to effectively pocket tax revenues.

Understanding  carousel  fraud  requires  knowl-
edge of the mechanics of VAT. Any company that
buys  and  sells  products  will  charge  VAT  to  the
consumers of its goods, and pay VAT to the pro-
ducers it purchases from. The rate of VAT charged
changes depending on the step in the buying and
selling  process.  Essentially,  VAT  tax  is  charged
each  time  a  product  moves  through  the  supply
chain  to  its  ultimate  consumer.  An  office  supply
company, for example, will charge individuals VAT
when they buy a box of printer paper. The same
supply company would have already paid VAT on
the same box of paper when it purchased it from
the manufacturer.

The office supply company would then turn over
the  net  VAT  (what  it  collected  from  consumers
subtracted  from  what  it  paid  to  the  manufac-
turer)  to  its  jurisdiction’s  tax  authority.  Compa-
nies  effectively  act  as  tax  collectors  for  govern-
ments under VAT systems.

This  allows  the  fraudster,  the  person  who  com-
mits fraud, to charge VAT on the sale of goods, and
then  instead  of  paying  this  to  the  government’s
collection authority, to simply abscond, taking the
VAT with him. The term “missing trader” refers to
the fact that the trader goes missing with the VAT.

More  sophisticated  schemes  are
typically
referred  to  as  “carousel  fraud,”  as  they  usually
involve  moving  products  around  between  multi-
ple  sellers  and  sometimes  countries.  In  a  carou-
sel  fraud,  products  will  be  sold  to  several  trad-

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

ers before being exported. One or more of those
sellers will pocket the VAT instead of paying it to
the government.

In many jurisdictions, exporting products incurs
no  VAT  tax.  The  exporter  will  then  reclaim  VAT
from  the  government  for  the  full  value  it  was
charged  by  the  sellers,  but  due  to  the  “missing
traders” further back in the chain, that VAT was
never paid to the government in the first place.

Carousel  fraud  is  prevalent  in  the  European
Union, due to the number of nations that use VAT
and the fact that EU member states do not charge
VAT on exports. Carousel frauds are often perpe-
trated  by  organized  crime  rings  because  of  the
number of persons needed and relative complex-
ity of this type of fraud scheme.

TAX FRAUD THROUGH
OFFSHORE ENTITIES
Offshore companies and other entities are among
the  most  common  and  widespread  avenues  for
evading taxes globally. An offshore account is sim-
ply one held in a different country or jurisdiction
than  the  one  where  the  accountholder  resides
and has tax liability. Often, offshore accounts are
held in tax havens.

International Business Companies (IBCs). These
are  a  form  of  legal  entity  that  is  typically  incor-
porated in tax or secrecy havens, such as Panama,
the  British  Virgin  Islands  and  the  Seychelles,  as
well  as  emerging  offshore  destinations,  such  as
Ireland and Singapore. IBCs are intended to exist
solely for the purpose of conducting international
trade or financial transactions and typically can-
not conduct business in the jurisdiction in which
they are incorporated. The attraction of IBCs for
tax  evasion  purposes  stems  from  their  secrecy.
Typically, in tax havens, a tax identification num-
ber is not required to open a bank account for an
IBC,  and  limited  or  no  ownership  information  is
publicly available.

Offshore Trusts. These are another type of legal
entity typically formed in tax or secrecy havens.
The  main  advantage  of  a  trust  is  that  it  can  be
used  to  cloak  ownership  of  accounts  or  assets.
Many  jurisdictions  either  do  not  collect  infor-
mation  on  the  beneficial  owners  behind  such
trusts,  or  do  not  publicly  share  such  ownership
information.

Personal  Investment  Corporation  (PIC).  Also
referred  to  as  an  “offshore  company,”  PICs  are
another  means  for  shifting  tax  liability  from  an
individual to a corporate entity formed in an off-
shore jurisdiction, typically a secrecy haven. Indi-
viduals can transfer assets and property to a PIC
and  retain  beneficial  ownership  over  them,  yet
avoid  paying  the  appropriate  taxes.  Frequently,
there  are  multiple  layers  in  the  formation  and
control of PICs. An offshore trust may open a PIC
with  a  law  firm  acting  as  nominee,  burying  the
individual or entity that truly controls the assets
and,  in  some  cases,  completely  obscuring  the
ownership of assets.

Captive  Insurance  Companies.  Like  other  tax
evasion  vehicles,  captive  insurance  companies
can be completely legitimate and formed for real
business reasons. A captive insurance company is
formed  when  a  group  of  businesses  or  individu-
als  creates  an  insurance  company  that  is  wholly

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

owned  by  the  group  and  only  underwrites  their
own operations. In tax evasion schemes, individ-
uals or companies will form a captive in order to
claim a tax deduction on their insurance premium,
and then devise methods to return the premiums
paid to the participants.

Regardless  of  their  layers  or  complexity,  one
thing  that  tax  evasion  structures  usually  have
in common is the facilitation and involvement of
third  parties.  Law  firms,  private  banks,  accoun-
tants,  auditors  and  others  all  may  play  a  role  in
establishing tax shelter arrangements or offshore
operations,  and  in  secrecy  havens  these  third
parties  may  form  a  thriving  industry  sector.  In
some  financial  crime  matters,  these  intermedi-
aries  may  be  a  good  source  of  information  and
potential  evidence  on  the  whereabouts,  transac-
tions and assets of a financial criminal.

SPECIAL PURPOSE
VEHICLES/ENTITIES
A special purpose entity (SPE) is also referred to
as a special purpose vehicle (SPV), or a financial
vehicle corporation (FVC). SPEs are also referred
to as “bankruptcy-remote entities” or “derivatives
product companies.”

A  SPE  is  a  subsidiary  corporation  and  a  legal
entity,  usually  a  limited  company,  created  with
the  purpose  of  executing  some  type  of  specific
or  temporary  objective.  The  main  reason  com-
panies create SPEs is to help protect them from
financial risk. There are situations in which com-
panies  abuse  the  power  of  SPEs,  such  as  in  the
case of Enron, but that aside, SPEs are legal, inno-
vative  and  widely  used.  SPEs  provide  a  range  of
securities  backed  by  assets,  such  as  cash  flow
on  car  loans,  credit-card  and  home-equity  debt,
manufactured-housing  loans,  student  loans  and
equipment leases. Additionally, companies trans-
fer assets to SPEs for management or use them to
finance a project.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

120

The establishment of an SPE is similar to the cre-
ation  of  a  company  in  that  there  must  be  pro-
moters  or  sponsors.  A  sponsoring  company  will
isolate  certain  assets  into  the  SPE.  This  isola-
tion  of  assets  is  important  for  providing  com-
fort  to  investors  because  there  are  fewer  risks
associated with it. With the assets and activities
distanced  from  the  parent  company,  the  perfor-
mance  of  the  new  entity  will  not  be  affected  by
the ups and downs of the originating entity. Ulti-
mately, a good SPE should be able to stand on its
own, independently of the sponsoring company.

There are several main reasons for creating SPEs.
They may help with securitization, or assist com-
panies  with  isolating  high-risk  projects  from  a
parent organization. This also allows other inves-
tors to take a share of the risk.

Multi-tiered SPEs also allow multiple tiers of debt
and investment, or can be used for asset transfer.
For  example,  many  permits  that  are  required  to
operate  certain  assets  are  either  non-transfer-
able or difficult to transfer. By having an SPE own
the asset and the permits, the SPE can be sold as
a self-contained package.

Another reason companies create SPEs is to help
maintain the secrecy of intellectual property..

Finally,  SPEs  are  used  in  financial  engineering
schemes.  The  main  goal  is  usually  avoidance  of
tax or manipulation of financial statements.

Sometimes, SPEs are illegally used. In these cases,
SPEs are typically used to hide debt or ownership,
or  to  obscure  relationships  between  different
entities which are actually related to each other,
like  in  the  case  of  Enron.  SPEs  sometimes  even
allow  tax  avoidance  strategies  that  are  unavail-
able elsewhere.

Enron  is  the  biggest  example  of  the  misuse  of
SPEs. In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds
of SPEs to hide its debt. Enron used the SPEs for
more  than  just  avoiding  accounting  conventions.

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

The  company  established  these  numerous  enti-
ties  to  shield  itself  from  mark-to-  market  losses
in its growing equity investment business. When
these investments started going downhill, Enron
attempted to support the SPEs with its own stock,
which was only a temporary solution at best.

Although  Enron’s  use  of  SPEs  was  illegal,  many
companies  use  these  vehicles  to  legally  con-
duct “off-balance sheet” transactions. As long as
SPEs are not abused, they can be very beneficial
to companies.

REPATRIATING
UNDISCLOSED ASSETS
Once  their  proceeds  are  safely  placed  in  a  cor-
porate  entity,  shelter  or  haven,  a  financial  crim-
inal  still  faces  the  dilemma  of  how  to  access
and repatriate his or her assets without alerting
the  tax  authorities  or  law  enforcement  within
the  jurisdiction  in  which  they  reside.  There  are
myriad avenues:

•  Credit cards set up to draw from a tax

evader’s off-shore account

•  Loans from offshore lenders, shell

corporations or legal entities ultimately
controlled by the tax evader

•  The use of property held by offshore entities

at zero or below-market rental

•  False invoices for services or goods that a tax
evader charges to an offshore entity that they
ultimately control

•  Scholarships or charitable foundations

that covertly funnel funds to a tax evader’s
relatives or associates

In  addition  to  these,  it  is  not  uncommon  for
third parties to facilitate the movement of funds
or  assets  from  a  tax  evader’s  offshore  accounts
to  their  jurisdiction  of  residence.  In  extreme
instances,  employees  of  law  firms  or  private
banks have physically brought cash or high-value
assets to tax evading clients in other jurisdictions.

121

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

Such  was  the  case  with  the  “client  advisors”  at
Swiss banks Wegelin and UBS, who would fly to
the US to meet with wealthy US tax evaders and
purchase artwork, jewelry and other luxury items
with funds from Swiss accounts to assist them in
transferring assets.

DEMONSTRATING TAX FRAUD
IN LEGAL CASES
The  tax  codes  of  many  jurisdictions  are  highly
complex,  and  reporting  requirements  are  not
always widely known or intelligible to an average
taxpayer. As a result, the courts of many nations
have  established  a  relatively  high  standard  for
proving  tax  fraud,  recognizing  that  mistakes
are  common.  Typically,  a  government  must  go
beyond showing that a taxpayer misstated his or
her  taxes  or  did  not  pay  any  taxes,  and  demon-
strate  that  a  taxpayer  actually  had  the  intent  to
commit fraud.

While  these  cannot  be  considered  evidence  or
proof, the following are useful as indicators sug-
gesting tax fraud:

•  Repeated patterns of underpayment of taxes

•  Lack of records to substantiate income,
deductions and other items in tax filings

•  Extensive use of cash transactions

•  Destruction or alteration of financial records,
especially those pertaining to tax liability

•  Failure to provide an accountant or other tax
professional with necessary information to
prepare tax returns or filings

EMPLOYMENT TAX FRAUD
Tax  evaders  are  not  only  drawn  from  the  ranks
of  the  wealthy  or  from  multinational  corpora-
tions. Businesses of all sizes engage in tax evasion
and employment tax fraud schemes are prevalent
mechanisms  for  doing  so.  These  schemes  take
a  variety  of  forms,  but  usually  revolve  around
improperly  withholding  or  not  paying  to  the

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

government  the  taxes  employees  pay  and  that
employers withhold.

Common employment tax fraud schemes include
the following:

Third  party  withholding  fraud.  Many  smaller
businesses  rely  on  payroll  service  providers  or
other  third-party  employment  firms  to  manage
the  process  of  the  withholding  taxes  employees
pay. Just like the employers themselves, however,
these companies can collect the employment tax
but fail to report it to the appropriate tax author-
ities. Companies should be aware of this type of
tax fraud, as it  can result  in liability to the com-
pany and to the third-party perpetrator.

Worker  status  misstatement  or  falsification.
Employers may improperly categorize a full-time
employee  as  part  time,  or  record  an  employee
as  a  contractor  in  order  to  lessen  or  avoid
certain taxes.

Pyramiding. This refers to a company that with-
holds  taxes  from  employees,  such  as  for  Social
Security in the US, but willfully fails to pay them
to  the  appropriate  tax  agency.  These  schemes
tend to have a short lifespan. The title “pyramid”
refers to the manner in which as tax withholdings
which  are  not  being  turned  over  to  the  govern-
ment  agency  build  up,  it  becomes  more  difficult
for the employer to catch up on the back-tax lia-
bility it owes.

Cash  payments.  If  the  employer  has  large,  unex-
plained  periodic  cash  payments,  or  other  infor-
mation suggests that employees are being paid in
cash, it is a likely indicator of tax fraud because of
cash payments. It is not uncommon for employers
to  pay  employees  in  cash  to  evade  the  employ-
ment tax requirements.

Offshore  employee  leasing.  This  refers  to  when
a  taxpayer  resigns  from  his  employment  posi-
tion  and  signs  an  employment  contract  with  an
offshore  employee  leasing  company,  which  indi-
rectly leases his services to his original employer.

122

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

The employee performs the same services before
and  after  entering  into  the  leasing  agreement
and generally receives the same payment for his
services.  However,  his  salary  is  sent  offshore  as
“deferred”  compensation,  in  which  employment
and income taxes may be avoided.

RED FLAGS OF TAX FRAUD
Because  of  the  thin  line  that  sometimes  exists
between outright tax evasion and aggressive but
legal tax avoidance schemes, pointing to specific
actions or behaviors as definitive red flags can be
difficult in the tax enforcement field. As a result,
the financial crime specialist should know the tax
laws of the pertinent jurisdiction well, or consult
with a tax professional before pursuing an inves-
tigation or legal action related to tax fraud.

Some acts or situations are fairly clear indicators
that  tax  fraud  by  an  individual  or  organization
is  occurring.  Some  potential  red  flags  include
the following:

•  Deliberately ignoring or failing to follow
advice of an accountant, attorney or
return preparer

•  Knowingly failing to inform a tax professional

of all the relevant facts for the accurate
preparation of tax filings or returns

•  In the case of tax fraud by a business,

evidence or testimony from employees about
irregular withholding of taxes or suspicious
business practices

•  Destroying or altering books and records,

especially if it occurs just before or after an

•  audit or examination by tax authorities

•  The sudden transfer of assets in a manner

that suggests concealment, or the diversion
of funds by company officials or trustees,
especially to an offshore location or
secrecy haven

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

•  A significant or repeated pattern of incorrect

or understated income on tax returns

•  Applications and tax and related documents

that appear to be backdated

•  Use of multiple identification numbers
by a single person or entity, or the
use of incorrect or non-existent
identification numbers

•  Submission of false wage and

other statements

INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES TO
DETECT AND PROVE TAX FRAUD
For  the  most  part,  investigative  methods  that
focus on tax evasion overlap with financial crime
investigative  methods.  A  financial  crime  special-
ist who is an investigator of his or her country’s
tax agency must access tax documents and have
knowledge of how to obtain tax information that
is  typically  out  of  the  reach  for  other  financial
crime specialists.

Like  other  financial  crime  investigations,  a  tax
fraud  investigation  usually  starts  by  gathering
relevant records and other data that provide evi-
dence of the tax affairs of the subject. The inves-
tigator records where, when and from whom the
information was obtained and pursues the leads.
Tax evasion or suspicious behavior by a taxpayer
is  often  a  sign  that  a  larger  fraud  or  financial
crime has occurred.

As with all financial crime investigations, all doc-
uments  and  other  evidence  obtained  must  not
be  modified  by  the  investigator  in  any  way.  The
investigator  must  also  maintain  a  clear  chain  of
custody to log how the custody and control of the
records  changed  or  progressed  from  the  time  it
was  initially  obtained  to  the  time  it  is  used  in  a
legal  proceeding.  A  financial  crime  professional
investigating  tax  evasion  and  other  fraud  must
always strive to obtain the taxpayer’s explanation
for  discrepancies  in  financial  records  and  other

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

123

documents,  and  ensure  that  their  explanations
are recorded clearly and accurately.

In  some  circumstances,  financial  crime  spe-
cialists  will  investigate  a  case  in  which  a  tax
return has not been filed, and tax or other fraud
is suspected.

When conducting a tax evasion investigation, the
first  contact  with  the  subject  presents  a  crucial
opportunity  to  obtain  the  point  of  view  of  the
taxpayer  and  other  important  information.  Tax
evasion investigations often follow an audit by the
examiners of the tax agency, in which the subject
taxpayer may not be aware that the agency may
be  considering  a  criminal  tax  evasion  investiga-
tion focused on him or her.

As  a  result,  the  subject  may  provide  informa-
tion or access to financial and other documents
that they would otherwise take pains to conceal,
which may be difficult to obtain in later stages of
the investigation.

Some questions that should be asked in the initial
interview of the target taxpayer are as follows:

•  Who was responsible for preparing the tax

documents and returns?

•  Who was responsible for approving
the statements, including income,
deductions and expenses, cited in the tax
filing or returns?

•  Who was responsible for management of the

person’s income or business affairs?

•  How were the person’s income or business
receipts calculated and documented for
tax filings?

TAX INFORMATION
EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS
When  conducting  investigations  across  national
borders,  tax  information  exchange  agreements
can  be  powerful  resources.  Tax  information
exchange  agreements  (TIEAs)  are  bilateral  trea-

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

ties  that  provide  a  framework  for  sharing  infor-
mation  in  criminal  or  civil  tax  investigations.  A
model  TIEA  was  originally  developed  by  the
OECD’s  Global  Forum  Working  Group  on  Effec-
tive Exchange of Information and have since been
adopted by dozens of countries worldwide.

Jurisdictions  negotiate  the  terms  of  TIEAs
between  themselves,  and  the  specifics  may  vary
slightly  depending  on  the  countries  involved.
Generally, TIEAs allow one jurisdiction to request
a  wide  range  of  information  that  is  “foreseeably
relevant”  to  the  enforcement  of  tax  laws,  includ-
ing  details  on  financial  accounts  and  beneficial
ownership  information  on  companies  or  trusts.
Information  shared  is  usually  subject  to  strict
confidentiality  requirements,  and  can  only  be
shared with courts or judicial bodies for the pur-
poses of determining criminal or civil tax issues.

The OECD maintains a database tool that allows
anyone  to  view  the  TIEAs  that  a  country  has  in
place  with  other  countries.  This  can  be  a  useful
resource  for  understanding  the  overall  tax  com-
pliance  and  potential  tax  evasion  risk  on  a  juris-
diction  level.  If  a  country  does  not  have  many
TIEAs  in  place,  or  is  not  effectively  following  up
on requests for information, it could indicate that
the  jurisdiction  has  lax  tax  compliance  or  is  act-
ing as a secrecy haven.

THE UNITED STATES FOREIGN
ACCOUNT TAX COMPLIANCE ACT
2010 (FATCA)
A  landmark  tax  reporting  law,  the  2010  US  For-
eign  Account  Tax  Compliance  Act  is  one  of  the
most sweeping changes to international tax com-
pliance and enforcement ever enacted. Targeting
US  tax  evaders  with  undeclared  assets  offshore,
FATCA  compels  all  financial  institutions  outside
the  US  to  collect  and  report  to  the  US  Internal
Revenue  Service  the  US  persons  that  maintain
accounts at their institutions. Failure to do so will
subject the pertinent non-US institutions to a 30

percent  withholding  tax  on  US  income,  in  addi-
tion to other applicable taxes.

$50,000 for an individual and $250,000 for a
corporation must then be reported to the IRS.

Although it is a US law, FATCA’s reporting require-
ments  cover  banks  and  other  financial  institu-
tions in all jurisdictions, making it a truly global
law.  Non-US  financial  institutions  may  face  con-
siderable  challenges  and  steep  costs  to  comply
with FATCA, according to several studies.

FATCA  was  inspired  by  a  tax  evasion  scandal
centered  on  UBS,  one  of  Switzerland’s  largest
banks. UBS was found to have maintained secret
bank accounts for about 52,000 US persons who
wanted  to  evade  their  US  taxes.  UBS  was  prose-
cuted by the US Department of

Justice,  leading  to  the  disclosure  of  more  than
4,000 US taxpayers who had hidden accounts at
UBS.  The  case  provoked  the  US  Congress  and
paved the way for FATCA.

According  to  estimates  at  the  time  of  FATCA’s
implementation,  the  IRS  expected  to  recover  $8
billion in tax revenue from offshore accounts over
the  next  10  years.  The  total  may  be  far  higher.
Because  of  the  close  ties  between  tax  evasion
through  offshore  accounts  and  other  financial
crime,  FATCA  has  the  potential  to  unearth  mil-
lions  in  criminal  proceeds  linked  to  corruption,
money laundering, fraud and sanctions violations,
in addition to tax evasion.

FATCA has three key operative provisions:

1.  Non-US financial institutions, which can

include banks, broker-dealers and investment
firms, depending on the non-US jurisdiction
and other circumstances, must identify any
US persons who hold accounts and gather
their names, addresses and tax identification
numbers, as well as their account balances,
deposits, withdrawals and other information.
US persons include individuals and business
organizations formed in the US. Information
on any US accountholders with more than

2.  Non-US institutions that do not comply with
the law are subject to a 30% withholding
tax on certain payments originating in the
US, as said above. Payments subject to the
tax include income, rents, dividends, wages,
and certain interest payments. These are
known as “fixed or determinable annual or
periodical” (FDAP) payments.

3.  US persons with offshore accounts must

file a new IRS Form 8938 with the IRS along
with their annual income tax return if
their accounts hold more than $50,000. US
persons that fail to file this new form may be
subject to a penalty of up to 40 percent of
the account value.

July  1,  2014,  was  the  first  effective  date  of  many
of  FATCA’s  key  provisions.  Because  of  the  sheer
complexity  and  scale  of  the  law,  provisions  took
effect in stages through 2017.

FATCA  is  phased  in  over  a  long  period  of  time
to allow the US and other nations to resolve the
legal obstacles that stand in the way of the law’s
implementation. Many jurisdictions do not permit
financial  institutions  in  their  territory  to  share
tax  information  and  other  financial  information
with the US and other nations. Some nations and
other  jurisdictions,  including  many  EU  coun-
tries,  forbid  exchange  of  tax  information  that  is
automatic  and  not  in  response  to  a  court  order
or formal government request. As a result, many
nations must amend their laws and regulations to
permit FATCA compliance.

INTERGOVERNMENTAL
FATCA AGREEMENTS
In  the  process  of  implementing  the  worldwide
obligations that FATCA imposes on financial insti-
tutions in other countries, the US Internal Reve-
nue  Service  has  pursued  and  succeeded  in  cre-
ating  “Intergovernmental  agreements,”  or  IGAs,
with  other  nations.  As  of  April  2014,  dozens  of

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

125

nations in various parts of the globe2 have signed
IGAs with the US. It is very likely that many more
nations  in  all  parts  of  the  world  will  sign  these
agreements with the US. In essence, IGAs outline
how the signatory nation and its financial institu-
tions will comply with the reporting requirements
of  FATCA.  The  US  has  developed  two  template
IGAs, Model I and II, which are outlined below:

•  The Model I agreement, released in early

2012, requires non-US institutions to report
information on US accountholders to their
own tax authorities, which would collect the
information and deliver it to the IRS.

•  The Model II agreement requires non-US
institutions to report information on US
accountholders directly to the IRS instead of
their own tax authorities. It allows non-US
institutions to exchange tax information
with the IRS on request and supplement it
when necessary. FATCA partner countries
that enter a Model II IGA must enable its
reporting institutions to register with the
IRS and comply with FATCA’s due diligence,
reporting, and withholding requirements.

The  Model  I  and  II  templates  produce  distinct
IGAs,  each  with  varying  terms.  Financial  crime
specialists  should  know  if  a  country  of  interest
has  entered  into  an  IGA  with  the  US  Treasury
Department and review its provisions.

Both models allow the IRS to request more infor-
mation  about  so-called  “recalcitrant  accoun-
tholders,”  or  US  persons  who  refuse  to  provide
information  required  for  FATCA  compliance.
Depending  on  the  terms  of  an  IGA,  non-US
institutions  may  be  required  to  close  accounts
of  recalcitrant  taxpayers  under  some  circum-
stances, but not all IGAs require this.

Model  I  agreements  allow  the  IRS  to  request
more information on recalcitrant accountholders
from the partner nation’s tax authorities. Model II
also allows the IRS to make group requests to the

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

partner  country’s  tax  authority  for  information
on  recalcitrant  accountholders.  This  informa-
tion may be collected and reported to the IRS on
an aggregate basis. The IRS may also request US
financial  institutions  for  information  about  pay-
ments to non-US institutions that refuse to com-
ply with FATCA.

One  potential  problem  for  organizations  that  is
present  in  multiple  jurisdictions  is  the  manage-
ment of FATCA due diligence requirements under
two models. Institutions may be required to build
multiple  systems  to  meet  the  requirements  of
applying the two models to local laws.

FATCA COMPLIANCE FOR US INSTITUTIONS
While  non-US  institutions  shoulder  much  of  the
data  processing  and  reporting  burden  under
FATCA,  US  institutions  are  not  exempt  from
major  challenges.  Among  other  things,  they  are
required  to  enforce  the  30  percent  withholding
tax  imposed  on  noncompliant  non-US  institu-
tions. Consequently, US institutions must be pre-
pared to sort and classify their accounts to know
which of them is held by overseas institutions that
are FATCA compliant, non-compliant or exempt.

US  institutions  must  also  conduct  ongoing  mon-
itoring  of  the  accounts  they  house  for  foreign
institutions in case their FATCA compliance status
changes. To ease this process for US institutions,
the  IRS  created  an  online  FATCA  registration
“portal.” The portal includes access to a database
of FATCA-compliant non-US institutions.

The  bi-national  IGAs  also  present  compliance
burdens.  Many  of  the  agreements  call  for  recip-
rocal  reporting,  which  requires  US  institutions
to  identify  accountholders  of  a  nation  that  has
signed an IGA with the US Treasury Department
and to report these accountholders to the appro-

they will be required to classify their accounts by
citizenship  or  tax  nationality,  collect  supporting
documents and monitor accounts for changes in
status.  Adding  to  that  analytic  and  compliance
headache  are  the  differences  in  IGAs  described
above, which could require US institutions to col-
lect different account information  or  identifying
documentation  based  on  the  terms  of  the  IGA
with  a  particular  FATCA  partner-nation.  In  time,
there  may  be  dozens  of  different  IGAs  that  US
institutions will have to comply with.

FATCA COMPLIANCE FOR NON-US
INSTITUTIONS
It  was  not  until  January  2013  that  the  US  Inter-
nal  Revenue  Service  released  the  final  regula-
tions on FATCA, which were enacted in 2010. As a
result,  the  international  financial  services  indus-
try had been facing considerable uncertainty on
how to proceed. The final rules that were issued
by the IRS finalize a step-by-step process for US
account identification, information reporting and
withholding  requirements  for  foreign  financial
institutions  (FFIs),  other  foreign  entities  and  US
withholding agents. They are contained  in  more
than 500 pages of regulatory language, examples
and other provisions that have earned for FATCA
and  its  regulations  a  well-earned  reputation  for
complexity.3

Even with final rules in place, non-US institutions
still face considerable compliance challenges.

There  is  no  one-size-fits-all  FATCA  compliance
standard  or  template.  Complying  with  the  law
and  the  regulations  will  depend  on  the  type  of
institution and its customers, as well as whether
an  institution  is  located  in  a  jurisdiction  with  a
FATCA IGA with the US Treasury Department.

Differences aside, the key first step for all non-US
institutions  is  to  gather  the  records  and  other
data  it  has  on  accountholders,  determine  the
data that are or were being collected at the time

the  customer  relationship  was  established,  and
understand  the  gaps  that  exist  in  the  customer
information. It makes little sense for institutions
to  take  any  implementation  steps  without  first
understanding  the  customer  data  they  have.  A
strategy  to  identify  and  gather  the  missing  ele-
ments, if any, would be required.

Other  steps  advisable  to  take  or  consider  for
FATCA compliance include the following:

•  Analyzing your customer procedures and
amending them, if necessary, to capture
information pertaining to a customer’s
citizenship status or tax nationality, along
with related documents and records.

•  Classifying customer accounts by

appropriate categories, including those for
US and non-US persons by compliant and
“recalcitrant” status. Institutions will need to
have or develop systems to monitor account
activity related to other institutions to
classify them by FATCA-compliant and non-
compliant status.

•  Building or acquiring new monitoring

systems to detect and flag any changes to
accounts that affect how they are reported
for purposes of FATCA.

•  Develop procedures and data systems to
process and report to the IRS, or other
appropriate tax authorities under an IGA
agreement, the appropriate documentation
when an account’s status is in question or
has changed.

•  For financial institutions in nations with

certain bank secrecy laws, obtaining a signed
waiver form from account holders indicating
they consent to have their account data
reported to the IRS.

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

THE OECD’S COMMON REPORTING
STANDARD – AN EVOLUTION IN
GLOBAL TAX COMPLIANCE
Efforts  to  boost  global  financial  transparency
and  augment  tax  compliance  did  not  end  with
the  implementation  of  FATCA.  Instead,  the  US
was only the start of a larger and more globalized
effort - The Common Reporting Standard issued
by the OECD.

Prompted  by  the  creation  of  FATCA  and  by
European  Union  efforts  to  increase  financial
data-sharing for tax purposes, in 2014, the OECD
developed a framework for automatic tax informa-
tion exchange that can be adopted by any nation.

Instead of FATCA’s unilateral reporting structure,
in which all countries are effectively required to
report to US tax authorities, the Common Report-
ing Standard (CRS) is a multilateral system. Each
country  that  agrees  to  participate  must  direct
its  financial  institutions  to  identify  accounthold-
ers  from  all  other  participant  countries,  and
report  account  information  to  tax  authorities.
This information is then shared between the tax
authorities  of  all  participant  countries  annually,
on an automatic and ongoing basis, beginning in
September 2017.

While  there  are  notable  differences,  the  steps
required  to  comply  with  the  CRS  and  the  infor-
mation on financial accounts being captured and
exchanged  are  broadly  similar  to  the  require-
ments of FATCA. The CRS covers both individual
and  legal  entity  accounts,  including  trusts  and
foundations.

The CRS itself consists of four parts:

1.  A model Competent Authority Agreement

that lays out the legal framework countries
adopt to participate in automatic exchange.
It is functionally similar to the Model I and II
agreements under FATCA.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

128

2.  Standards that establish how information

should be collected, verified and reported to
tax authorities

3.  Commentaries that provide further

information on the Standards and Competent
Authority Agreement

4.  Technical guidance to support the data
collection and transmission required
under the CRS

As  of  early  2017,  there  were  more  than  100  juris-
dictions  that  had  agreed  to  implement  the  CRS.
The Common Reporting Standard requires finan-
cial  institutions  to  report  generally  the  same
information  as  FATCA,  with  some  notable  differ-
ences.  Each  signatory  country  must  gather  the
following information:

•  The name, address, taxpayer identification
number and date and place of birth of each
customer covered by reporting requirements.
This includes most individual accounts and
accounts for certain legal entities.

•  The customer account number

•  The name and identifying number of the

Reporting Financial Institution

•  The account balance or value as of the end
of the relevant calendar or, if the account
was closed during such year or period, the
closure of the account

This  represents  a  significant  evolution  in  global
tax  compliance  and  financial  account  transpar-
ency.  Previously,  this  type  of  financial  account

CHAPTER 6 • TAX EVASION AND  ENFORCEMENT

information  was  only  shared  when  one  country
requested  it  from  another  under  the  terms  of
a  tax  information  exchange  agreement.  These
requests were usually only made as part of crimi-
nal or civil investigations, and, in many cases, the
exchange process was slow.

The  automatic  and  ongoing  exchange  under
the  CRS  greatly  increases  the  level  of  transpar-
ency  in  the  global  financial  system.  The  frame-
work cuts down on the ability of tax evaders and
other financial criminals to shield assets from tax
authorities by moving them offshore.

It should be noted that like FATCA, the CRS con-
tains loopholes – certain legal entities and types
of financial institutions are not subject to report-
ing,  for  example.  Also,  like  FATCA,  dozens  of
countries have not agreed to implement the CRS,
including large economies like the US.

Although  tax  and  secrecy  havens  have  not  been
eliminated,  the  CRS  tightens  the  net  on  tax  eva-
sion.  With  fewer  places  to  hide,  tax  evaders  are
being  forced  to  resort  to  methods  that  are  less
convenient,  more  expensive  and  potentially  eas-
ier to detect.

As tax evasion is closely connected to other forms
of  financial  crime,  this  movement  toward  tax
transparency  also  has  ramifications  for  enforce-
ment  efforts  against  money  laundering,  corrup-
tion and fraud.

CHAPTER 7

 ASSET
RECOVERY

OVERVIEW

Whatever  the  financial  crime,  there  is  a  certain  and  common

element.  The  financial  criminal  leaves  someone  or  something

behind  in  poorer  condition  than  they  were  before  the  crime.

Whether it is a fraud, corruption, tax evasion or money launder-

ing,  at  the  conclusion  of  the  offense,  there  is  money  or  some-

thing of value in the hands or control of the financial criminal

that does not belong to him and should be recovered.

131

Financial  crime  creates  the  opportunity  or
necessity  to  recover  assets  that  have  been  ille-
gally  taken.  Consequently,  asset  recovery  is  the
essential endgame of all financial crime.

Because  of  this  necessity,  the  skills  and  special-
ized knowledge of investigators, lawyers, forensic
accountants  and  other  professionals  who  under-
stand  the  unique  challenge  of  asset  recovery
efforts  are  at  a  premium.  Asset  recovery  skills
in  financial  crime  cases  are  crucial  because  so
much of the asset recovery work that needs to be
done  in  the  wake  of  financial  crime  depends  on
private  resources.  Government  agencies,  which
have  heavy  workloads,  usually  devote  compar-
atively  few  resources  to  tracing  and  recovery  of
financial  crime  proceeds  of  the  huge  number  of
cases they must handle.

The  level  of  recovery  of  all  financial  crime  pro-
ceeds is very low. Of an estimated $500 billion in
criminal  proceeds  that  are  generated  each  year
in  the  US  alone,  for  example,  no  more  than  $5
billion  is  recovered  through  government  asset
recovery efforts. It is estimated that private sec-
tor asset recovery efforts recover even less from
financial criminals.

Although there are significant overlaps with other
elements  of  financial  crime,  including  investiga-
tions, compliance and prosecutions, asset recov-
ery  requires  unique  proficiencies  and  skills,  and
poses  distinct  challenges.  These  skills  are  not
always  the  same  as  those  required  to  investi-
gate  the  financial  crime  and  its  perpetrators.  In
the  same  way,  asset  recovery  skills  are  not  the
same as those used to detect and document the
disguising,  hiding  and  laundering  of  the  crimi-
nal proceeds.

Asset is the fourth phase of financial crime inves-
tigations.  First  is  the  investigation  of  the  crime
and  the  perpetrators.  Next  is  the  investigation
of  the  money  laundering  by  the  perpetrators
and any accomplices. Third is the prosecution or

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

other resolution of the offense that the financial
criminal has committed.

The  final  phase  is  where  the  asset  recovery  pro-
fessionals  trace  and  recover  the  financial  crime
proceeds.  Unless  the  proceeds  of  the  financial
crime  are  recovered,  the  victim  and  the  gov-
ernment  agencies  that  investigate,  prosecute  or
assure compliance by entities through which the
criminal proceeds flowed, the game is lost, even if
the perpetrators go to prison.

PARTICIPANTS IN AN ASSET
RECOVERY TEAM
Asset  recovery  operations  are  typically  con-
ducted by teams of professionals, each with their
own  distinct  skill  set  and  focus.  Private-  and
public-sector asset recovery teams have more in
common than most people realize. They typically
have similar team members who do similar jobs:

•  Investigators. In the public sector, they
are called special agents, detectives or
commanders, and in the private sector they
are called private investigators.

•  Forensic Accountants. The private sector
usually calls them forensic accountants
while the public sector calls them auditors,
examiners and reviewers.

•  Lawyers. They are called prosecutors in

the government and receivers, insolvency
professionals, lawyers and trustees in the
private sector.

•  Investigative Analysts. They are sometimes

referred to as intelligence analysts in
the public sector and litigation support
specialists in the private sector.

Receivers,  trustees,  monitors,  “private  attor-
neys  general”  and  other  fiduciaries  are  usually
appointed  by  a  court  to  undertake  the  process
of mustering out the affairs of a legal entity that
has  served  as  a  vehicle  for  the  financial  crimes
perpetrated  by  its  principals.  The  laws  of  many

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

132

countries,  including  the  US,  United  Kingdom,
Canada  and  Australia,  provide  for  the  appoint-
ment of these persons to undertake the manage-
ment  and  control  of  such  entities  and  to  search
for,  identify  and  attempt  to  recover  their  assets.
As  is  explained  below  in  this  chapter,  there  are
many legal and equitable tools that these fiducia-
ries have at their disposal in a worldwide search
for assets to compensate the victims.

Asset  recovery  teams  in  the  private  and  public
sectors  use  similar  legal  and  investigative  asset
tracing  and  recovery  tools.  Government  agents
have search warrants and seizure warrants, while
the  private  sector  has  civil  search  warrants  and
other  tools  that  courts  of  equity  may  give  them,
as described below.

With  court  orders,  government  agents  can  forc-
ibly  enter  premises,  while  private  investigators
may obtain court orders that allow them to “break
and  seal”  the  premises  of  financial  crime  perpe-
trators or their accomplices.

This  chapter  of  the  manual  explains  tools  and
resources  that  asset  recovery  specialists  have,
the knowledge they should have about asset trac-
ing,  and  the  recovery  weapons  and  skills  they
should  ensure  their  team  has.  This  chapter  will
also  cover  the  unique  issues  that  multinational
asset  recovery  efforts  confront,  and  how  they
should be dealt with.

IMPORTANCE OF SOUND PLANNING
Sound pre-seizure planning is a must for effective
asset recovery in both the public and private sec-
tors. Even when an asset recovery team has the
legal authority to freeze, seize or take an asset, it
may not be in the best interest of the overall asset
recovery effort to do so.

Before  doing  so,  an  asset  recovery  team  in  both
sectors should consider the following:

1. Does the asset have value?

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

The  value  of  an  asset  should  be  determined
before any action is taken. Its value includes both
its  monetary  worth  as  well  as  its  importance  to
the financial criminal. Assets that appear to have
a high market value may be heavily encumbered
with mortgages, liens or other legal impediments.
This makes their monetary value low or possibly
even negative. Still, if a government agency views
an asset as being worth little, but recognizes that
it  plays  an  important  role  in  the  criminal  activi-
ties  of  an  organization  or  financial  criminal,  sei-
zure  must  be  considered  regardless  of  its  value.
However, it should be kept in mind that even sei-
zure of an asset costs money.

2 How much will it cost to maintain and preserve
the asset during the asset recovery process?

After an asset is seized or taken in an asset recov-
ery effort, the asset recovery team must store and
maintain it until a court orders the divestiture and
return of the asset to the victim, the victim‘s rep-
resentative or a government agency order. If the
asset  requires  maintenance  and  upkeep  during
this time before a final order by a court, the cost
of maintaining the asset may escalate rapidly.

3.  Are  there  potentially  innocent  owners  of  the
asset who may impede or prevent recovery?

Sometimes, an asset targeted in an asset recovery
effort is owned by a third party, even in the case
of money that has been taken in a financial crime,
such as in the case of charitable contributions by
the  financial  criminal  or  funds  contributed  to  a
political campaign. If the financial criminal is not
the owner and the owner of the asset is not impli-
cated  in  the  financial  crime  or  the  illegal  move-
ment of the financial crime proceeds, freezing or
seizure  of  the  asset  may  not  be  an  appropriate
course of action.

MAKING THE CASE FOR
ASSET RECOVERY
For law enforcement and other government agen-
cies, a successful seizure of an asset is the begin-

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

133

ning of the asset recovery process. Presenting a
strong  case  to  a  prosecutor  for  seizure  and  ulti-
mate  recovery  is  a  vital  first  step.  Government
agents and investigators should submit complete
and accurate requests to the prosecutor or other
legal  officer  detailing  the  probable  cause  for  sei-
zure,  freezing  and  ultimate  recovery.  The  sub-
mission  should  list  the  potential  claimants  that
may emerge and full information about such per-
sons and their likely claim. The investigators are
often  required  to  furnish  the  legal  officer  sup-
plemental investigative reports as they learn new
information.

Below are the recommended elements of a report
by  investigators  to  a  government  legal  officer
or  prosecutor  before  an  asset  recovery  effort  is
commenced, or when seizure of an asset is being
considered,  which  also  largely  apply  to  private
sector asset recovery teams.

The  presentation  or  submission  to  the  legal  offi-
cer or private sector lawyer should be organized
so  that  relevant  information  that  allows  evalua-
tion  of  the  case  is  found  quickly.  These  are  the
items  of  information  that  a  prosecutor  or  other
legal  officer  in  the  private  and  public  sectors
would normally request:

A list of each tangible or intangible assets, and
pieces  of  property  for  which  asset  recovery  is
sought.  For  purposes  of  presentations  in  court,
the  prosecutor  or  legal  officer  must  accurately
list  each  item,  with  complete  description  of  the
asset.  It  is  important  that  the  asset  recovery
team  is  mindful  of  the  passage  of  time  because
many jurisdictions prescribe the number of days
that  an  asset  recovery  team  in  the  government
or  private  sector  has  to  commence  or  complete
procedures, including applications to the courts.
The  location  of  an  asset  is  important  because
legal issues pertaining to the rights of parties in
other jurisdictions must be addressed, and there
must be certainty that the asset recovery team is
legally empowered to act in the jurisdiction.

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

An  actual  or  appraised  value  for  each  item  or
asset  that  is  the  target  of  an  asset  recovery
effort.  The  value  and  nature  of  an  asset  may
determine the type of legal procedure to be initi-
ated in various jurisdictions. Certain jurisdictions
permit  the  seizure,  freezing  or  ultimate  recov-
ery  of  assets  of  a  certain  value  by  an  adminis-
trative  action.  Assets  that  do  not  fall  into  those
categories  in  these  jurisdictions  may  be  recov-
ered  only  through  judicial  proceedings  and  not
administratively.

Names  and  full  contact  information  of  all  per-
sons who may have a legal or other interest in an
asset that is the focus of an asset recovery effort
or  that  has  been  frozen  or  seized.  The  laws  of
most  jurisdictions  require  that  names  of  poten-
tial claimants with an interest in an asset that is
sought  to  be  frozen  or  seized  be  received  prior
formal  notification  of  the  contemplated  action.
For this reason, it is important that the legal offi-
cer or prosecutor in an asset recovery effort have
the  accurate  names,  addresses  and  full  contact
information  of  the  potential  claimants  so  that
they may be provided with legal notices in accor-
dance with the law.

A  listing  of  all  registered  owners  and  persons
holding  liens  on  assets  that  are  the  focus  of  a
seizure, freezing or other asset recovery effort.
Property  owners  routinely  record  their  vehicle
and  interests  in  real  estate  in  the  records  and
files  maintained  by  government  offices.  These
databases,  which  are  normally  accessible  by  the
general  public,  must  be  searched.  Parties  with
recorded  interests  affecting  the  targeted  assets
must  be  listed  in  the  reports  presented  to  the
legal  officers  in  a  public  or  private  sector  asset
recovery  effort  so  that  they  may  receive  the
required legal notice of the action. The legal offi-
cer or prosecutors must evaluate this information
to determine if the potential claimants have legit-
imate claims or have the legal status that is nor-
mally called “innocent owners.”

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

134

A  statement  explaining  the  legal  theory  and
justification  or  probable  cause  for  the  seizure,
freezing  or  ultimate  recovery  of  each  item  or
asset.  A  legal  officer  or  prosecutor  needs  and
benefits  from  a  concise  description  of  the  the-
ories  of  seizure,  freezing  or  recovery  that  the
asset recovery team will pursue. The description
should include the full justification, or “probable
cause,“ that the asset recovery team will pursue,
which  justifies  the  seizure,  freezing  or  recovery.
The  investigative  or  analysis  team  that  provides
information  to  the  legal  officer  or  prosecutor
should  strive  to  furnish  full  information  to  jus-
tify the recovery of the asset and linking its pur-
ported owner to the underlying financial crime.

Complete  copies  of  all  investigative  and  analy-
sis reports and search warrants or other court
orders.  Legal  officers  and  prosecutors  must
review  the  investigative  reports  to  evaluate  the
basis of seizure, freezing and ultimate recovery of
specified assets. In the case of a government asset
recovery  effort,  search  warrants  must  contain
a  statement  of  probable  cause  that  summarizes
the investigation and the evidence leading to the
search for and subsequent seizure of an asset.

Copies  of  all  seizure  orders,  warrants  or  other
court orders previously issued in the case. Prior
orders of the court, including a seizure order or
warrant, will detail the justification or “probable
cause“ that justified the taking of an asset.

The  laws  of  most  nations,  including  the  US,
require  that  a  government  asset  recovery,  or
“forfeiture,“ action must be commenced within a
specific  time  from  the  date  an  asset  was  frozen
or  seized.  Government  investigators,  and  often
those in the private sector, should recognize that
legal  officers  and  prosecutors  have  minimum
thresholds  of  property  value  in  asset  recovery
cases. These thresholds are dictated by consider-
ations of the proper and efficient use of legal and
judicial resources.

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

ANCIENT AND POWERFUL EQUITABLE
POWERS OF COURTS
The  equitable  powers  of  the  court  are  based  on
the  principle,  “Where  there’s  a  wrong,  there’s
a  remedy  --  if  you  come  with  clean  hands.”  An
asset  recovery  team  has  potent  weapons  based
on  these  judicial  equitable  powers.  A  court  may
compel  disclosure  of  information,  issue  civil
search  warrants  and  “break  and  search”  orders,
rewrite contracts, transfer property, require the
examination of documents, and enter orders per-
mitting the seizure of assets.

Equity is the name given to a set of principles that
are applied in common law jurisdictions, such as
the  US,  United  Kingdom,  Canada,  Australia  and
other nations that inherited a system of law from
England.  The  principle  of  equitable  relief  is  also
intended  to  supplement  and  complement  the
remedies  and  relief  that  statutory  law  provides.
Equitable  relief  is  also  intended  to  apply  where
the  application  of  statutory  law  may  be  unduly
harsh,  unfair  or  inequitable.  Although  equity  in
that name is not known in civil law systems, such
as those that operate in continental Europe, Latin
America  and  most  of  Asia,  those  systems  have
and  apply  broad  rules  that  give  judges  similar
powers  to  fashion  remedies  to  meet  inequitable
circumstances.

Equitable powers constantly adapt and evolve to
meet new circumstances, particularly in the busi-
ness and commercial environment. Common Law
courts have invented a host of equitable remedies
that are powerful tools for asset recovery. These
include  things  such  as  so-called  Mareva  Injunc-
tions,  Anton  Piller  Orders  and  Norwich  Pharma-
cal Orders that may be used in the investigation
and initial steps of asset recovery cases. They can
also  require  a  party  to  permit  a  legal  represen-
tative  of  another  party  to  search  premises  and
remove evidence.

Among  the  powerful  weapons  that  a  court  of
equity  may  wield  in  asset  recovery  and  other
cases are these:

135

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

•  Restraining and mandatory injunctions

that compel certain action or inaction by a
specified person or entity

•  Civil search warrants that permit private

sector asset recovery teams, accompanied
by law enforcement authorities, to search
designated premises for evidence

•  Break and search orders that permit the

forcible entry into businesses or residences,
usually in the company of law enforcement
authorities, to search for evidence pertaining
to a financial or other crime

•  Accounting that compels a person or entity
to document the source and application of
funds, which are the subject of a financial
crime or other investigation, or to require a
broader accounting

•  Appointment of receivers who essentially
represent the court in undertaking the
management and control of a specified entity,
including its assets and property, that are
linked to a financial or other crime or to its
insolvency or bankruptcy

•  Writ of assistance to a sheriff or court official

that requires the designated officials to
provide assistance to the representatives of
the victims of a financial or other crime

•  Authentication of records, or ‘back channel’

assistance, on beneficial owners

Through  whatever  appropriate  means  evidence
and  records  are  located  and  obtained,  an  asset
recovery  team  must  ensure  that  the  documen-
tation may be used in subsequent legal proceed-
ings  that  seek  to  achieve  repatriation  of  assets.
Various  international  agreements,  in  addition  to
local laws of most nations, provide procedures for
the  authentication  of  records  obtained  in  other
countries.  The  foreign  ministries  of  most  coun-
tries or the office of a nation‘s chief legal officer
normally have units that facilitate the necessary
authentications.

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

In  addition,  the  embassies  in  other  countries  of
an  asset  recovery  team‘s  country  can  provide
helpful “back channel“ assistance in various ways,
including location of witnesses, authentication of
documents or direction to useful public sources
of information in that country that may uncover
the  true  beneficial  owner  of  corporations  and
other legal entities. Often, this is the most daunt-
ing task in an international asset recovery effort.

Victims of financial crime, and often government
agencies, may undertake various legal actions to
seek to recover the assets they have lost in a finan-
cial  crime.  For  example,  through  their  represen-
tatives, victims may apply to a court to freeze an
asset or its transfer or consumption and request
the judicial imposition of a constructive trust to
ensure that the assets are not dissipated.

FREEZING ORDERS AND “MAREVA
INJUNCTIONS”
One  of  the  most  powerful  tools  in  international
asset recovery is a freezing order. In many juris-
dictions,  it  is  called  a  Mareva  injunction.  The
name  comes  from  a  1980  British  case,  Mareva
Compania  Naviera  SA  vs.  International  Bulk  Car-
riers,  SA,  in  which  the  court  order  restrained  a
party from removing assets from the jurisdiction
and from dealing with any assets wherever they
were located.

Freezing  orders  are  usually  sought  against  the
persons who hold an asset or other property. In
jurisdictions  where  freezing  orders  are  estab-
lished  or  permitted,  such  as  in  the  United  King-
dom, Canada and the US, there must be an argu-
ably  good  case  on  the  merits,  strong  evidence
that  the  assets  are  located  in  the  jurisdiction  or
outside the jurisdiction if a global order is sought
from  the  court,  and  evidence  that  a  definable
risk exists that the person holding the asset may
unjustifiably  dissipate  it  to  frustrate  enforce-
ment  of  an  asset  recovery  effort  or  a  judgment
entered by a court.

Freezing  orders  are  powerful  and  can  be  used
effectively  with  a  variety  of  assets,  especially
bank  accounts  or  real  property.  Freezing  orders
typically require that the asset not be transferred
or  removed  without  a  court  order.  While  these
orders  do  not  guarantee  recovery  of  the  assets,
they assure that the assets will not be transferred
or dealt with in a prejudicial or harmful manner
until the case is concluded.

A  freezing  order  should  be  sought  in  the  place
where  the  financial  criminal  or  his  accomplices
reside  or  hold  property.  Sometimes,  it  is  possi-
ble  to  obtain  a  worldwide  Mareva  order  from  a
court  if  the  financial  criminal  has  fled  the  juris-
diction,  but  not  all  countries  recognize  these
global orders.

Other  well-known  judicial  tools  provide  assis-
tance  in  asset  recovery  efforts  in  common  law
countries  or  jurisdictions.  The  terms  by  which
these tools are known are included in parentheses:

NORWICH PHARMACAL (PURE BILL OF
DISCOVERY) AND BANKERS TRUST
ORDERS (PRODUCTION ORDER)
These  orders  by  a  court,  usually  under  seal  and
accompanied by so-called anti-tip-off or gagging
restraints, are injunctions that typically seek dis-
closure  of  confidential  records  and  information
from  financial  institutions  and  other  businesses.
The  orders  usually  require  a  third  party  to  dis-
close  certain  documents  or  information  to  the
party that sought the orders. For example, a third
party could be a financial institution that has rel-
evant information and records.

ANTON PILLER ORDERS (STAND
AND DELIVER)
These are search and seizure orders that may be
executed simultaneously at homes and offices of
the  targets  they  are  issued  on.  An  Anton  Piller
order is intended to preserve evidence that may
be  crucial  to  a  worldwide  asset  tracing  case.  It
can  be  obtained  to  preserve  evidence  where  it

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

is shown that the target of the effort is likely to
destroy evidence to frustrate the investiga- tion.

LIS PENDENS
A lis pendens is simply a written notice that a law-
suit or claim affecting title or an interest in spe-
cific real property has been filed.

Lis  pendens,  which  is  Latin  for  “suit  pending,”  is
the  notice  of  a  pending  action  and  is  filed  with
and certified by the clerk or secretary of a court
it  is  subsequently  recorded  in  the  official  regis-
try of the place where the property is located. It
notifies  persons  with  an  interest  in  the  subject
real property that a claim on the property exists.
The recording of the lis pendens informs anyone
interested  in  buying  or  financing  the  property
that there is a potential claim against it.

A  lis  pendens  must  include  a  legal  description
of  the  property.  Usually,  in  common  law  juris-
dictions, the party who filed a lis pendens is not
required  to  show  a  substantial  likelihood  of  suc-
cess on the merits, but only a connection between
the ownership of the property and the dispute in
the pertinent lawsuit.

LETTERS ROGATORY
A  letter  rogatory  is  a  request  from  one  judge  to
another  judge  in  another  country  seeking  assis-
tance  in  obtaining  information,  documents  or
testimony  in  a  particular  legal  matter.  Letters
rogatory  are  not  treaties,  but  they  provide  a
means  by  which  private-  and  public-sector  per-
sons and agencies may obtain international assis-
tance in a case. Letters rogatory can help gather
financial  evidence,  including  bank  records,  and
help to restrain assets. Compliance with a letter
rogatory is discretionary on the part of the court
that  receives  it,  and  the  process  is  usually  slow.
Without an effective advocate in the jurisdiction
that receives it, a letter rogatory may not succeed
in obtaining the desired assistance.

Each country has its own laws and practices for
the receipt and execution of letters rogatory. Exe-

137

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

cution of letters rogatory must be in strict com-
pliance with domestic law. The process is marked
by these uncertainties:

•  Letters rogatory are usually transmitted via
diplomatic channels and must be processed
through a court and the diplomatic agencies.
Diplomats may refuse to act if a letter is
deemed inconsistent with their nation’s
public policies.

•  Requests must contain certain information,
including a description of the facts and
details of persons and entities involved. The
letters may be returned for clarification to
the judge in the requesting country.

•  Nations sometimes refuse to execute letters
rogatory in a criminal matter until formal
criminal charges have been filed in the
requesting country. This policy makes letters
rogatory unavailable during the investigation
when they are often most needed.

•  In some countries, secrecy laws do not
permit bank records to be obtained by
means of letters rogatory unless other laws
authorize this disclosure.

REPATRIATION OF ASSETS
In asset recovery cases, it is not enough to freeze
assets.  To  succeed,  they  must  be  repatriated.
Repatriation of assets from foreign hiding places
is  the  crucial  final  step  that  private  and  public
asset recovery teams must accomplish. It may be
fraught with complications.

In repatriating assets, government asset recovery
teams  often  have  unique  international  weapons
that  can  provide  substantial  help  in  the  recov-
ery. Private sector asset recovery teams may also
have access to powerful government weapons in
certain  circumstances  if  they  convince  govern-
ment  investigators,  prosecutors  or  judges  to  uti-
lize  them  on  their  behalf.  The  discussion  below
about  Mutual  Legal  Assistance  Treaties  (MLATs)
covers this.

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

There  are  no  standard  procedures  that  asset
recovery  teams  must  follow  for  successful  repa-
triation of assets. No two cases, and the laws of
no two countries, are alike. Asset recovery cases
sometimes encounter difficulties that stem from
local  corruption,  especially  in  the  final  stages
when repatriation is sought.

Asset recovery teams must obtain a judicial order
to  repatriate  assets  after  they  are  located  and
frozen to prevent dissipation or flight. The order
must divest the financial criminal and his accom-
plices of the asset and place title in the control or
the names of the victims, their representatives or
a pertinent government agency.

Mareva  injunctions  or  other  court  orders  at  the
start  of  a  case  that  preclude  the  financial  crim-
inal  or  his  accomplices  from  transferring  or  liq-
uidating  assets  are  essential  initial  steps.  The
laws  of  certain  jurisdictions  allow  creation  of
so-called asset protection trusts. A trust protec-
tor  appointed  by  the  court  usually  may  transfer
assets from one jurisdiction to another.

STATUTES OF LIMITATION
An  asset  recovery  team  must  also  observe  stat-
utes  of  limitation  as  a  potential  obstacle  in  its
case.  Statutes  of  limitations  vary  from  jurisdic-
tion  to  jurisdiction  and  encourage  prompt  reso-
lution  of  cases.  However,  statutes  of  limitations
can  also  sometimes  benefit  financial  criminals,
if  they  succeed  in  concealing  their  conduct  and
assets until the statute of limitation expires. The
time period that a statute of limitation prescribes
is  easily  learned  in  any  jurisdiction,  and  should
be one of the first things an asset recovery team
does. Often, these statutes impose different time
limitations for different types of legal actions.

One way to mitigate the negative effect of a stat-
ute of limitations that expired or is about to expire
is to enter into “tolling“ and standby agreements
with  adverse  parties  by  which  they  agree  to
ignore the statute of limitations problem. That is
unlikely when you are dealing with the financial

138

criminal and his accomplices unless a bargaining
or negotiation benefit can be extended in return.

DISCOVERY
Discovery  is  the  process  by  which  parties  in  a
legal  dispute,  including  financial  crime  victims
and  their  representatives,  may  obtain  informa-
tion  from  opposing  parties  in  a  case.  In  asset
recovery  cases,  the  information  may  pertain
to  the  nature,  location  and  value  of  a  particular
asset and other things of value. The US has very
broad  discovery  rules  in  civil  litigation,  but  dis-
covery  is  also  permitted  in  other  common  law
countries,  such  as  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada,
Australia and others.

Countries  that  operate  in  what  is  known  as  the
civil  law  system,  generally,  do  not  have  similar
discovery  rules,  although  other  measures  exist
that  provide  mutual  disclosure  of  pertinent  evi-
dence between the parties.

Distinct  discovery  options  and  rules  apply  in
civil  and  criminal  cases  in  countries  that  per-
mit  discovery.  In  criminal  cases  in  most  coun-
tries,  the  defendants  may  not  be  forced  to  pro-
duce evidence that represents self-incrimination.
Often, this privilege is guaranteed by the nation‘s
constitution,  such  as  in  the  US.  In  the  US,  cor-
porations  do  not  receive  this  protection  against
self-incrimination.

INFORMATION SHARING AND
MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE
TREATIES (MLATS)
An  information-sharing  agreement  is  an  under-
standing between government agencies by which
they  agree  to  exchange  information  that  assists
them  in  their  work,  including  asset  recovery.
These agreements can be in the form of a formal
agreement,  protocol,  memorandum  of  under-
standing, exchange of letters, or a treaty or con-
vention. The Hague Convention, for example, pro-
vides  for  international  cooperation  in  obtaining

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

THE HAGUE CONVENTION
The Convention on the Taking of Evidence
Abroad  in  Civil  or  Commercial  Matters  --
more commonly referred to as the Hague
Evidence  Convention,  is  a  multilateral
treaty  which  was  drafted  under  the  aus-
pices of the Hague Conference on Private
International  Law.  The  treaty  was  nego-
tiated in 1967 and 1968 and signed in The
Hague  on  March  18,  1970.  It  entered  into
force  in  1972.  It  allows  transmission  of
letters  of  request  (letters  rogatory)  from
one signatory state (where the evidence is
sought) to another signatory state (where
the evidence is located) without recourse
to consular and diplomatic channels.

The  Hague  Evidence  Convention  was  not
the  first  convention  to  address  the  trans-
mission  of  evidence  from  one  state  to
another.  The  1905  Civil  Procedure  Con-
vention — also signed in The Hague — con-
tained  provisions  dealing  with  the  trans-
mission of evidence. However, that earlier
convention  did  not  command  wide  sup-
port and was only ratified by 22 countries.
The  United  States  initiated  the  negotia-
tions that led to the creation of The Hague
Evidence Convention. However, insofar as
requests to United  States  courts are  con-
cerned,  the  use  of  the  Hague  Evidence
Convention  has  been  replaced  in  large
part  by  the  simpler  discovery  provision
codified  at  28  U.S.C.  §  1782  (see  Section
1782 Discovery).

Between  states  of  the  European  Union,
the  Hague  Evidence  Convention  has
largely  been  supplanted  by  Council  Regu-
lation (EC) No. 1206/2001 on Cooperation
Between the Courts of the Member States
in the Taking of Evidence in Civil or Com-
mercial Matters.

evidence  for  use  in  legal  proceedings  of  various
types.  All  appropriate  international  agreements,
such as the Hague Convention, that provide chan-
nels  of  information-sharing  should  be  reviewed
by asset recovery teams in the private and public
sectors at the start of a case.

In  addition,  as  discussed  in  more  detail  in  other
chapters  of  this  Manual,  in  accordance  with
Egmont  Group  recommendations  some
132
nations  have  established  Financial  Intelligence
Units (FIUs). These agencies collect a wide variety
of financial information and reporting forms from
financial  institutions,  businesses  and  individuals
in their countries and disseminate it to their law
enforcement agencies and prosecutors. They also
sign bilateral and multinational agreements that
authorize  and  facilitate  the  mutual  exchange  of
intelligence and information.

MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATIES
Mutual  Legal  Assistance  Treaties  (MLATs)  pro-
vide  for  the  broad  exchange  of  information,
assistance  and  other  cooperation  between  two
nations.  In  an  international  asset  recovery  case,
they  can  be  a  valuable  tool  for  gathering  perti-
nent  information  and  evidence.  The  execution
and  operation  of  MLATs  is  often  cumbersome
and time-consuming.

Most  MLATs  require  the  requested  country  to
assist  the  requesting  nation  to  take  actions  that
include these measures:

•  Taking testimony or statements of persons

•  Providing documents, records and evidence

•  Service of documents

•  Locating or identifying persons

•  Executing requests for search and seizure

•  Identifying, seizing and tracing

proceeds of crime

The  “requested“  party  in  an  MLAT  request  usu-
ally pays all costs related to its execution, except

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

for the fees of expert witnesses, translation, tran-
scription and travel expenses.

MLATs  may  only  be  used  by  government  agen-
cies and are designed for their benefit. However,
under  some  circumstances,  as  explained  below
in  this  chapter,  representatives  of  private  sec-
tor  victims  of  financial  crime  may  persuade  the
lawyers  or  agents  of  a  government  agency  that
have  received  information  under  an  MLAT  from
another country to share the information.

Government asset recovery teams have no obsta-
cles to the use of MLATs if they have been signed
and  ratified  by  their  countries.  Many  industrial-
ized countries have entered into dozens of MLATs.
The US, for example, has entered into more than
60  of  them,  as  of  early  2013.  A  full  listing  of  all
the  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements  that  a
nation  has  ratified  may  usually  be  found  in  the
website  of  a  jurisdiction‘s  state  department  or
foreign ministry. In the US, the website of the US
State Department provides this listing in a publi-
cation called Treaties in Force.

An example of how an MLAT describes the assis-
tance  the  signatory  nations  agree  to  extend
to  the  other  nation  is  found  in  Article  16  of  the
MLAT  between  the  US  and  the  United  Kingdom,
which follows:

“The  parties  shall  assist  each  other  in  pro-
ceedings  involving  the  identification,  tracing,
freezing,  seizure  or  forfeiture  of  the  proceeds
and  instrumentalities  of  crime  and  in  rela-
tion to proceedings involving the imposition of
fines related to a criminal prosecution.“

Most MLATs include restrictions on the use of the
information they provide.

A government agency that files an MLAT request
may seek permission to share information with a
court-appointed  receiver  or  other  formal  repre-
sentative  of  financial  crime  victims.  If  the  infor-
mation  is  sought  for  restitution  to  victims,  the
government  officials  should  so  specify  in  the

140

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

request.  It  is  advisable  that  private  sector  rep-
resentatives  of  financial  crime  victims  establish
appropriate,  cordial  professional  relationships
with these government officials.

Parties that are considering the filing of an MLAT
request  should  consider  all  possible  uses  of  the
information  you  may  provide.  The  language  of
the  request  should  cover  all  the  intended  uses
of  the  information  and,  generally  speaking,  it  is
advisable to request approval for broad usage of
the information.

MLATs can be helpful in piecing together money
trails  in  financial  crime  cases,  including  those
involving  corruption.  They  can  lead  to  the  dis-
covery of bank accounts, property ownership or
evidence of the ownership of business entities.

Often,  nations  provide  mutual  assistance  under
other types of international agreements that can
impact  asset  recovery  case.  These  agreements
include  Organization  for  Economic  Co-  opera-
tion  and  Development  (OECD)  Anti-Bribery  Con-
vention,  the  Inter-American  Convention  Against
Corruption, the Council of Europe Criminal Law
Convention on Corruption, the Council of Europe
Civil  Law  Convention  on  Corruption,  and  the
United Nations Convention against Corruption.

An MLAT request for assistance is normally made
in writing and usually includes the following:

1.  The name of the agency conducting
the investigation, prosecution or
other proceeding

2.  The facts about the subject of

the investigation, prosecution or
other proceeding

3.  The nature and stage of the matter

and the text of the relevant laws of the
requesting party

4.  A description of the assistance requested

5.  A description of the purpose of the

requested assistance

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

The requested party in an MLAT can be instructed
to  keep  confidential  the  request  that  has  been
made, the contents of a request, the outcome of
the  request‘s  execution  and  other  information
concerning the request.

BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY AS
ASSET RECOVERY TOOLS
The asset tracing and recovery fields have several
off-the-beaten-path legal weapons, such as bank-
ruptcy  and  insolvency.  They  can  serve  very  well
in  locating,  safeguarding  and  recovering  assets.
Persons  appointed  by  courts  as  trustees,  receiv-
ers,  administrators,  monitors  or  liquidators  of
entities  that  have  served  to  spawn  or  execute  a
financial crime are given great powers of investi-
gation and recovery of assets. Especially in finan-
cial crime cases, in which the business or corpo-
rate entities that financial criminals use collapse
upon  the  discovery  of  the  financial  crime,  the
tools  discussed  here  are  important  parts  of  the
asset recovery arsenal.

A  trustee,  receiver  or  liquidator  steps  into  the
shoes of the directors of the business entity and
is  entitled  by  law  to  all  information  about  the
entity  to  which  its  directors  were  entitled.  Simi-
larly, a trustee in bankruptcy steps into the shoes
of  the  bankrupt  entity  and  is  entitled  by  law  to
all the information to which the bankrupt entity’s
directors were entitled.

Judicial  orders  appointing  receivers,  liquidators
or “officeholders,“ as they are called in the United
Kingdom,  typically  require  the  subjects  of  asset
recovery  efforts,  their  agents  and  all  persons
in  concert  with  them  who  receive  notice  of  the
order,  to  hand  over  all  assets  that  belong  to  the
subject entity or receivership. These cover secu-
rities, money and property of any kind, including
all  money  at  financial  institutions  for  the  bene-
fit of the targets of the investigation. The laws of
many  nations  allow  a  receiver  to  take  control  of
assets located in other jurisdictions.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

141

All  nations  and  jurisdictions  have  an  interest  in
regulating improper conduct in their territory. If
assets  are  not  repatriated  by  a  person  who  has
been ordered to do so, a receiver will likely seek
recognition abroad of the order appointing him or
her, and try to convince a foreign bank to honor
the  request  to  transfer  the  funds.  These  efforts
may  require  proof  of  the  underlying  financial
crime  and  of  the  receiver‘s  plan  to  distribute
assets to the financial crime victims.

As  mentioned  above,  The  Hague  Convention
allows  parties  to  request,  through  a  bankruptcy
or  other  court,  the  assistance  of  another  nation
in obtaining evidence and testimony.

TRACING, FORFEITURE AND
SUBSTITUTION OF ASSETS
Courts may assist financial crime victims in sev-
eral ways in tracing and recovering assets. Under
common  law,  tracing  is  restricted  to  assets  that
originally  belonged  to  the  claimant,  and  to  the
profits from the asset or its substitute.

In  the  US,  Article  9  of  the  Uniform  Commercial
Code  provides  the  doctrines  that  are  applied  in
asset  tracing  by  a  creditor.  These  rules  guide
practitioners when the proceeds are commingled.

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

Forfeiture  is  defined  as  the  permanent  depriva-
tion of property by order of a court or other com-
petent  authority.  It  is  a  term  used  interchange-
ably with recovery and confiscation.

Forfeiture  is  handled  through  judicial  or  admin-
istrative  procedures  that  govern  the  transfer  of
ownership  of  specified  funds  or  other  assets  to
a government agency. Many countries, including
the US, have asset forfeiture laws that authorize
proceedings against assets that are the proceeds
of  criminal  activity  or  that  served  as  the  instru-
mentalities of crime.

Asset forfeiture or recovery laws vary depending
on the jurisdiction. An asset recovery team mem-
ber should study the laws on forfeiture and asset
recovery  in  the  jurisdiction  where  she  or  he  is
handling the case. Persons or entities that had an
interest in the assets at the time of forfeiture lose
all  rights  to  the  seized  or  frozen  funds  or  other
assets upon a judicial or administrative ruling of
forfeiture. Many nations, including the US, allow
both criminal and civil forfeiture.

CRIMINAL FORFEITURE
A criminal forfeiture accompanies a criminal con-
viction in countries that recognize both types of
forfeiture. It is an action against the defendant or
person.  If  a  defendant  is  acquitted  of  the  crime,
the government’s criminal forfeiture case against
him  fails.  In  a  criminal  forfeiture,  the  burden  of
proof  is  the  same  as  in  a  criminal  prosecution,
“proof beyond a reasonable doubt.“

Criminal  proceeds  may  be  the  subject  of  a
criminal  forfeiture  action  if  they  are  related  to
or  derived  from  criminal  activity.  There  is  no
requirement  that  the  proceeds  must  have  been
obtained  directly  from  an  illegal  act.  For  exam-
ple, if a financial criminal derives money from his
crime and then uses it to buy a car, then sells the
car and uses the money for a down payment on a
house,  the  portion  of  the  house  purchased  with
illicit funds may be considered criminal proceeds.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

142

CIVIL FORFEITURE
Civil or ‘in rem’ forfeiture, meaning a case against
the property, is a legal action against the property
based on a finding that it represents the proceeds
or instrumentality of unlawful activity. It is not an
action  against  the  asset’s  owner  but  against  the
property  (“rem“  means  thing),  and  is  unrelated
to  a  criminal  action  against  the  wrongdoer.  The
standard of proof is lower in a civil action, mean-
ing that the government lawyer must prove by a
“preponderance  of  the  evidence“  that  the  prop-
erty  was  used  in  the  commission  of,  or  to  facili-
tate, a crime, or was obtained illegally.

This is particularly useful in cases where a finan-
cial  criminal  has  not  been  apprehended  or  is
still  unknown,  but  illegally  obtained  assets  have
been  identified.  By  initiating  an  in  rem  proceed-
ing against the property, either the criminal must
default on the proceeding and automatically lose
if  they  do  not  show  up  to  claim  ownership,  or
show up and risk apprehension.

SUBSTITUTE ASSETS
The  incentives  a  defendant  has  in  transferring
assets  to  another
jurisdiction,  placing  them
beyond  the  reach  of  a  court,  or  taking  other
actions  to  render  his  property  unavailable  are
understandably  great.  As  a  result,  the  impact  of
asset recovery actions is lost unless the private or
public sector asset recovery team can recover or
forfeit non-tainted, substitute assets of the target
or the defendant and his accomplices.

Many  jurisdictions  provide  for  the  recovery  or
forfeiture  of  substitute  assets.  These  laws  per-
mit  recovery  of  untainted  assets  that  have  an
equivalent  value  to  the  assets  that  cannot  be
recovered because they have been spent, hidden
or dissipated.

The  action  is  against  the  person,  called  an  in
personam  action.  The  court  in  a  criminal  asset
recovery or forfeiture case may order the person
or defendant to pay a money judgment or forfeit
substitute assets, if the recoverable property has

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

been  dissipated  or  cannot  be  found.  Civil  asset
recovery  or  forfeiture  cases  do  not  permit  this.
Therefore,  criminal  forfeiture  is  more  powerful
as a law enforcement tool.

OTHER EVIDENCE-
GATHERING TOOLS
Court orders facilitating investigation are a prin-
cipal  mechanism  for  obtaining  information  in
asset  recovery  cases.  Private  sector  entities  are
often unwilling or legally unable to disclose infor-
mation about their finances or customers without
a court order that releases them from client con-
fidentiality restrictions.

The  following  are  examples  of  court  orders  that
may  be  issued  in  many  nations  and  serve  as
potent  evidence-gathering  tools  for  government
investigators:

Production  orders.  Require  individuals  to  pro-
duce  documents  and  are  frequently  served  on
banks  and  other  intermediaries  to  obtain  finan-
cial records.

Search warrants. Available to government inves-
tigators and are executed on the premises owned
by  targets  and  defendants.  They  may  also  be
used  on  other  premises  where  documents  and
information  are  located.  Investigators  also  often
request warrants allowing the seizure and exam-
ination  of  documents  that  cannot  reasonably  be
reviewed on the premises being searched. Private
sector  asset  recovery  teams  may  obtain  similar
weapons under the equitable powers of courts, as
explained above in this chapter.

Customer  information  orders.  Enable  an  inves-
tigator  to  discover  at  which  institution  an  indi-
vidual holds accounts. The orders may require a
bank to search for accounts held in the names of
aliases or in different spellings.

Account  monitoring  orders.  Require  financial
institutions  to  inform  government  investigators
regularly about transactions in an account and to

enforced  may  enter  appropriate  orders  giv-
ing  effect  to  these  remedies  granted  by  the
foreign court.

LIABILITY OF THIRD PARTIES
One  of  the  hallmarks  of  asset  recovery  actions
and  principles  and  financial  crime  cases,  in  gen-
eral, is that the financial crime perpetrator is not
the  sole  source  of  recovery.  Financial  criminals
are adept not only at taking money from others,
but  they  also  are  skilled  at  making  the  money
vanish in hiding spots and behind fronts that are
difficult to identify, penetrate and uncover. So, if
a financial criminal and the stolen assets vanish,
the victims are left with the challenge of identify-
ing third parties that may be liable for their losses
under various theories of liability.

Recovering  from  third  parties  has  several  major
advantages.  They  are  usually  stationary  and
immobile, have substantial assets and are averse
to bad publicity. They will resist paying, however.
Evolving legal theories of liability and a changed
legal atmosphere have made many wealthy third
parties  worthy  of  pursuit  in  nearly  all  financial
crime  cases,  big  and  small.  But,  battles  against
third parties can be very expensive.

PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS ON THIRD-
PARTY LIABILITY
Before  launching  a  legal  effort  against  a  third
party,  one  must  determine  the  assets  the  finan-
cial criminal has. Second, once affiliated parties,
enablers, aiders and abettors and facilitators with
assets  have  been  identified,  they  should  be  pur-
sued if the facts and the laws so justify. To make
this  determination,  two  preliminary  questions
should be posed:

Does  the  financial  criminal  have  a  license  or  a
parent company?

If  a  person  has  been  victimized  by  a  financial
criminal who is a licensed entity or a subsidiary
of  a  public  company,  the  chances  of  recovery
dramatically increase. When a financial crime is

furnish  information  that  did  not  exist  when  the
order was granted.

Disclosure  orders  and  subpoenas  or  summons.
Enable an investigator to require an individual to
attend  an  interview,  answer  questions  and  pro-
duce documents.

ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS
Most  countries  have  laws  modeled  on  the  Uni-
form  Foreign  Money  Judgments  Recognition  Act
that “recognizes” and enforces proper judgments
rendered  in  other  countries.  Simply,  when  this
occurs,  a  court  enters  a  judgment  that  is  sub-
stantially  the  same  as  the  one  entered  in  the
other  country.  Similarly,  judgments  entered  in
a  domestic  court  receive  the  same  treatment
and enforcement based on international notions
of “comity.”

If  a  foreign  judgment  orders  a  monetary  recov-
ery and the debtor has assets in the country or in
another  jurisdiction  that  recognizes  the  foreign
judgment,  the  person  pursuing  asset  recovery
may  take  advantage  of  enforcement  and  collec-
tion tools, as if the judgment had been entered in
a domestic court.

If another form of relief was obtained under the
foreign  judgment,  such  as  an  injunction,  the
domestic  court  where  the  foreign  judgment  is

committed by someone acting on behalf of such
an  entity,  the  biggest  hurdle  to  recovery  gener-
ally consists of proving liability instead of search-
ing for assets.

Does the financial criminal have assets or money?

Because  successful  financial  crime  and  fraud
schemes involve getting, transferring and spend-
ing large sums of money, records to reconstruct
the flow of funds will generally be available. Even
in  the  absence  of  reliable  records,  it  is  hard  to
execute  a  large  financial  crime  without  creating
an audit trail. These records will provide trails to
third  parties,  firms and  institutions that  may be
liable for damages for participating in the financial
crime or enabling or fostering it knowledgeably.

To lay the groundwork for the pursuit of third par-
ties, various possible steps should be considered:

Source  and  use  analysis.  All  bank  records  the
financial criminal and his accomplices used, bank
statements, both sides of all checks, deposit items
and wire transfers should be obtained. After this
data  is  placed  in  a  spreadsheet  or  account  rec-
reation  software,  the  money  that  came  into  the
accounts,  where  it  came  from,  how  much  was
spent, and where it went may be determined.

When  pursuing  third  parties,  a  keen  eye  should
be  trained  on  fee  payments  to  professionals,
including  “investment  advisors.”  After  it  is  input,
the  data  should  be  sorted  by  source  and  payee,
a  process  often  called  “Source  and  Use  Analy-
sis.”  This  can  show  how  much  money  the  finan-
cial criminal’s entity had at any point, how funds
were used as they came in, and how much went
to various recipients.

Identify  the  payees.  When  the  recipients  of  the
funds from the financial criminal are known, the
purpose of each payment should be determined.
The records of the financial criminal may answer
this  or  interviews  of  employees  may  do  so.  Oth-
erwise, subpoenas or requests for production of
records should be sent to the recipients to obtain
explanations. However, this may tip off recipients

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

of the illicit funds and increase the risk the money
or the recipients may disappear.

Understand  cash  withdrawals.  Often,  frequent
large cash withdrawals or unexplained transfers
from  an  account  are  noticed.  Look  for  explana-
tions, which may include the purchase of cashier’s
checks,  withdrawals  of  cash  to  purchase  money
orders  or  wire  transfers  at  other  institutions,
cash  withdrawn  for  deposit  into  other  accounts
at  other  institutions,  or  cash  payments  to  pub-
lic officials.

If  the  money  was  used  for  wire  transfers,  the
records  of  the  money  transmitter  or  funds
transfer  institution  will  document  this.  If  other
financial  accounts  are  suspected,  subpoenas  or
requests for production to the institutions where
the  accounts  are  maintained  should  be  issued.
Withdrawals  by  the  financial  criminal  should  be
cross-checked  against  travel  records,  includ-
ing credit card statements, to establish travel to
secrecy  havens  or  to  other  locations  soon  after
cash withdrawals.

Find  related  entities.  Determine  the  other  enti-
ties  the  financial  criminal  and  his  accomplices
have  created.  The  asset  recovery  team  should
check  corporate  and  other  public  records  to
determine other business entities that list him, his
family  members,  affiliated  companies  or  accom-
plices as officers, directors or registered agents.

Check public records. Many assets generate pub-
lic  records  when  they  are  purchased  or  trans-
ferred, whether they are homes, cars, boats, jew-
els,  airplanes,  negotiable  instruments  or  other
assets.  As  more  government  agencies  put  these
records on their websites, these searches become
easier to conduct. Searches should be expanded
to  look  for  ownership  by  family  members,  close
associates,  suspected  accomplices  and  affiliated
entities of the target.

Intelligence  sources.  Many  financial  criminals
realize  that  their  schemes  ultimately  will  fail.  At

145

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

that  point,  they  become  more  creative  in  hiding
assets, utilizing more cash transactions, transfer-
ring property to others, opening accounts at dif-
ferent financial institutions or purchasing goods
in  the  names  of  others.  These  actions  are  diffi-
cult to detect. The best sources for finding these
transfers  are  people  who  had  contact  with  the
financial criminal and his accomplices.

vent, may be voidable. For Ponzi frauds and other
financial crime schemes, the test of insolvency is
met  by  the  entity’s  financial  obligations  to  exist-
ing  investors.  Good  faith  transactions,  where
fairly  equivalent  value  was  given,  are  excepted.
This  protects  outside  service  providers  or  ven-
dors  who  acted  in  good  faith,  and  still  permits
receivers to recoup improper payments.

Some  sources,  like  former  spouses,  unhappy
employees  or  angry  investors,  can  provide
assistance. Other sources must be persuaded to
cooperate, which can come through compulsion,
such  as  subpoenas,  court  orders  or  protecting
self-interest, including the fear of being charged
with  crimes  or  sued  for  money,  and  incentives,
such as immunity from prosecution that must be
expended by government authorities.

Affiliated  entities.  The  affiliates  and  entities
of  the  financial  criminal  should  be  analyzed  to
determine if their conduct gave rise to liability, or
if their actions as agents of the financial criminal
created grounds to pursue their assets.

Gratuitous  donees.  Payments  by  financial  crim-
inals  that  benefit  others  are  also  recoverable
under the laws of many countries, including the
US. While payments by an entity of the financial
criminal  for  normal  business  expenses  are  not
voidable  if  the  payments  represented  fair  value
for  the  services  provided,  payments  to  satisfy
the debts of others, including the financial crim-
inal’s personal debts, are voidable. Examples are
the  payment  of  bank  loans  owed  by  employees
or affiliates of the financial criminal and the pay-
ment  of  the  indebtedness  for  assets  purchased
by  others.  Charitable  contributions  and  political
contributions  made  by  the  financial  criminal  or
the promoter of the financial crimes scheme are
also recoverable.

Fraudulent  conveyances.  Under  the  laws  appli-
cable to fraudulent conveyances, payments made
by  a  financial  criminal  or  his  entity,  when  the
payments  would  have  made  the  company  insol-

Overpaid  investors.  Investors  in  long-running
Ponzi and similar financial crime schemes some-
times  receive  more  in  distributions  than  they
contributed as capital. Distributions to investors
beyond the amount of their principal investment
must  be  returned  under  the  laws  of  most  coun-
tries,  including  the  US.  If  the  investor  or  victim
did not act in good faith because he or she knew
of  the  fraud  or  withdrew  funds  because  of  sus-
picions that something was not right, good faith
was  missing  and  a  receiver  or  other  fiduciary
can  demand  a  return  of  all  the  distributions
he received.

With these considerations taken into account, an
asset recovery team may focus on specific third
parties whose deep pockets may secure the res-
titution of the financial crime victims.

GATEKEEPERS AND INTERMEDIARIES
When a financial crime has come to an end, one
may  ask,  “Where  were  the  gatekeepers?”  This
refers  to  attorneys,  accountants,  brokers,  audi-
tors, investment advisors, consultants, corporate
directors  and  others.  They  often  play  a  crucial
role in facilitating or promoting a financial crime
and have a duty to prevent the crime in transac-
tions where they are involved. Under recent laws
in some countries, gatekeepers and intermediar-
ies must now actively attempt to avoid facilitating
a  financial  crime,  including  fraud.  If  they  fail  to
meet this obligation, they may be liable for some
or all of the losses incurred by the victims.

A  primary  consideration  in  any  claim  against  a
third party is whether that person or institution
owed  a  duty  of  care  to  the  defrauded  party  or

146

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

financial crime victim. Some courts will consider
whether they had a duty of care to persons about
whom  they  were  not  aware  when  their  profes-
sional responsibilities began.

THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY BE
HELD LIABLE TO FINANCIAL
CRIME VICTIMS
If  gatekeepers  and  intermediaries  act  as  cheer-
leaders  and  enablers  and  facilitate  a  financial
crime, they may rightly be considered aiders and
abettors or co-conspirators in the financial crime.
The  following  gatekeepers  and  intermediaries
may be liable if the financial criminal’s identified
and located assets are not sufficient to satisfy the
losses of the victims.

Banks. In most nations, banks must conduct due
diligence  examinations  on  their  account  hold-
including  “know  your  customer”  proce-
ers,
dures  required  by  anti-money  laundering  laws.
These are records an asset recovery team should
obtain. Usually, Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR/
STR)  may  not  be  disclosed  by  a  financial  institu-
tion under the laws of many countries, including
the  US.  An  asset  recovery  team  should  under-
stand the banking regulations in the jurisdiction
where  the  recovery  operation  is  taking  place  in
order  to  determine  the  reporting  and  record-
keeping  responsibilities  of  financial  institutions
and  businesses  used  by  the  target  of  the  oper-
ation.  Obtaining  this  information  can  help  sig-
nificantly  in  financial  crime  and  asset  recovery
investigations.

institution  records,

Financial
including  gov-
ernment-required  forms  they  file,  can  provide
a  wealth  of  information  in  asset  recovery  cases,
although the ability to access them is tightly reg-
ulated in many jurisdictions.

nal  hired  registered  financial  intermediaries  to
advise  him,  or  he  used  them  to  execute  trans-

CHAPTER 7 • ASSET RECOVERY

actions  during  the  commission  of  the  financial
crime,  the  intermediaries  may  be  liable  to  the
victims. Often, these firms must conduct due dili-
gence and implement “know your customer” pro-
cedures, just as banks do, on their customers and
counterparts.

Even  if  the  firms  were  fooled  by  the  financial
criminal, they may be liable if they failed to con-
duct sufficient due diligence or if their operational
procedures  were  lax,  or  if  they  can  be  viewed
as  having  aided  and  abetted  the  fraud  or  other
financial  crime.  For  example,  if  a  broker-dealer
executed  transactions  based  on  forged  signa-
tures, the firm may be liable if the broker-dealer
should have known that was improper.

Company  directors.  As  part  of  the  due  dili-
gence procedures, an asset recovery team should
attempt  to  determine  if  there  is  liability  on  the
part of the officers and directors of an entity that
did business with the financial criminal. Director
and officer liability insurance may be a source of
recovery for victims of financial crime. A failure by
the directors to obey their duty to creditors and
investors may give rise to claims against them by a
receiver or other fiduciary. Directors may also be
liable for wrongful or fraudulent trading or when
preferential payments were made to creditors.

Employees. Employees who held responsible posi-
tions may be held liable for failing to detect or halt
financial  crimes,  including  fraud,  of  which  they
had knowledge or should have had knowledge.

Attorneys.  To  the  extent  attorneys  helped  pre-
pare  solicitation  or  other  documents  that  con-
tained  false  information,  which  induced  invest-
ment by innocent third parties, they may be liable
if they failed to conduct sufficient due diligence.
Attorneys  may  also  be  forced  to  return  money
they received for representing the financial crim-
inal  if  the  money  was  paid  by  a  legal  entity  that
had been controlled by the financial criminal and
is now in bankruptcy. Retainers paid from stolen
funds may also be recovered.

Auditors and certified public accountants. A case
for recovery against an auditor may arise where a
duty  of  care  has  been  proved  and  the  duty  was
breached and led to a loss to a person to whom
the auditor owed the duty. An example is where
a  lender  suffers  a  loss  by  relying  on  a  compa-
ny’s  financial  statements  indicating  it  was  finan-
cially  sound  and  the  statements  are  supported

by  an  audit  report.  The  misstatement  could  be
the  result  of  fraud  by  company  management  or
from error. Determining if a duty of care is owed
by an auditor to a third party normally depends
on the circumstances, including the relationship
between the auditor and third party and how an
audit report was produced and communicated to
the third party.

CHAPTER 7 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

Q 7-1. In a Venezuela court case for fraud against individuals and companies around the
world, documents have been obtained that would be helpful in a related proceeding in the
US in Miami. Venezuela and the US are parties to the Hague Evidence Convention on the
Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters. No special laws exist in either
jurisdiction for the evidence sought.

To  ensure  these  documents  are  properly  received  in  evidence  in  the  US,  which  two  are
acceptable methods of requesting such evidence?

A.  Letters rogatory through the authority designed by Venezuela or other authority

allowed by such law

B.  Transmission of the discovery request to the target of discovery

C. Transmission through a private party, such as an attorney in Venezuela, if private

law so provides

D. Issuance of subpoena duces tecum and scheduling of place and time for the party to

make itself available for examination

 FINANCIAL
CRIME
INVESTIGATIONS

INTRODUCTION

Whether it is uncovering evidence of bribes paid to public offi-

cials or uncovering the true source of laundered funds hidden

behind  layers  of  nominees  and  front  companies,  successful

detection and prevention of financial crime is often the result

of  long  and  rigorous  investigation.  Just  as  all  financial  crimi-

nals share certain strategies to perpetrate their misdeeds and

conceal the illicit proceeds, the specialists charged with uncov-

ering their wrongdoing also share common investigative tools

and techniques.

149

This chapter describes some of the key methods
to  investigate  financial  crimes  and  gather  evi-
dence in compliance, enforcement and regulatory
cases. In some respects, except for a few notable
differences such as grand juries, the procedures
and  tools  available  to  financial  crime  specialists
in the private and public sector are similar. Con-
sequently, the investigative techniques presented
here are designed to be applicable to a wide range
of financial crime matters.

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  legal  and  inves-
tigative  techniques  in  financial  crime  are  often
closely  related.  In  many  cases,  a  financial  crime
specialist  will  be  conducting  an  investigation
as  part  of  a  legal  action  or  in  cooperation  with
a  legal  professional.  In  criminal  and  civil  cases,
the  financial  crime  specialist  must  take  care  to
conduct investigations in a way that ensures their
findings  can  be  used  as  evidence  in  a  legal  pro-
ceeding. As such, understanding some of the key
legal  principles  underpinning  civil  and  common
law systems, as well as criminal and civil cases, is
a  necessary  starting  point  for  a  financial  crime
investigation, as is discussed below.

CIVIL LAW AND
COMMON LAW SYSTEMS
Civil  law  is  a  legal  system  rooted  in  Roman  law.
It  is  the  most  prevalent  and  oldest  surviving
legal  system  in  the  world.  Its  primary  feature  is
that  laws  are  written  into  a  collection,  codified
and, for the most part, not determined by judges,
unlike most common law systems.

In  a  civil  law  country,  legislation  is  deemed  the
primary  source  of  law;  it  determines  the  rights,
remedies and actions available in a civil law juris-
diction. Unless there is specific legislation allow-
ing  for  a  particular  procedure,  that  procedure
is  generally  not  available  in  that  jurisdiction.  In
civil  law  systems,  courts  and  judges  tend  to  be
inquisitorial, often asking the questions that in a
common law system would be the province of the
prosecution/plaintiff or defense counsel.

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

Civil law courts are generally not bound by prec-
edent and are restricted to what is contained in
the  law.  Judges  within  the  civil  law  system  are
usually  specially  trained  judicial  officers  with  a
limited ability to interpret the law.

Civil  law  is  primarily  contrasted  with  common
law,  which  is  a  legal  system  that  developed  his-
torically  in  Anglo  Saxon  societies,  especially  in
England and its colonies. Common law countries
are most notably represented by the United King-
dom—members of what was historically called the
British Commonwealth, such as Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, India, Pakistan, the English-speak-
ing Caribbean islands—and the US.

The  US  inherited  and  adopted  this  legal  system
from  England.  Historically,  civil  law  and  com-
mon law differed in that common law developed
from  customary  practices  and  court  decisions
that  established  legal  principles  that  were  fol-
lowed over time by other courts and became the
“common  law”  or  precedent.  The  precedents  are
applied  by  courts  unless  legislation  prohibits  or
modifies a common law precedent.

Over time, many jurisdictions have incorporated
characteristics  of  both  systems  so  that  mere
codification and adherence to written laws is no
longer  the  defining  characteristic  of  a  civil  law
system.  Mixed  systems  that  combine  aspects
of  both  common  and  civil  law  systems  may  be
found  in  jurisdictions  such  as  Scotland,  Louisi-
ana, Namibia, the Philippines, Quebec, Sri Lanka,
Mauritius, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

The most notable continuing difference between
civil  law  and  common  law  is  in  the  approach
to  codes  and  statutes,  as  well  as  in  the  reme-
dies  and  procedures  available  to  resolve  claims
and disputes.

KEY DIFFERENCES IN CIVIL LAW AND
COMMON LAW SYSTEMS
In  civil  law  countries,  legislation  is  seen  as  the
primary  source  of  law;  therefore,  courts  base

150

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

their  judgments  on  the  provisions  of  codes  and
statutes  from  which  cases  are  resolved.  Courts
under the civil law system have to reason on the
basis of general rules and principles in the provi-
sions  of  the  code,  sometimes  drawing  analogies
from  other  code  provisions  to  fill  in  gaps  in  the
law or achieve coherence.

By  contrast,  in  the  common  law  system,  case
law  is  the  major  source  of  guidance,  providing
rules  of  conduct,  liability,  interpretation  of  stat-
utes,  documents,  actions  and  contracts.  Courts
in  common  law  countries  are  frequently  asked
to  apply  to  the  facts  of  the  case  legal  principles
that  are  derived  from  precedents.  Common  law
courts  often  fashion  legal  remedies  that  are  not
specified in a statute.

Legal  proceedings  under  the  two  systems  also
vary.  Civil  law  courts  are  generally  inquisito-
rial,  with  the  judge  acting  as  fact-finder  in  the
case.  Civil  law  judges  may  ask  the  parties  ques-
tions  designed  to  see  how  the  facts  of  the  case
square  up  against  the  requirements  of  the  code.
Common law proceedings are adversarial, with a
prosecutor and defense attorney or plaintiff and
defendant squaring off against each other.

For  a  financial  crime  specialist,  recognizing  the
type of system that may be available or applicable
in a given case is important. This can help in eval-
uating which jurisdiction may be more appropri-
ate  to  initiate  or  pursue  claims  or  litigation,  as
well as in determining the cost and effort of pur-
suing a claim, and the likelihood of success.

CRIMINAL LAW AND CIVIL LAW
Criminal law is the body of law involving the state
against  individuals  (including  corporations,  legal
entities,  and  other  organizations),  in  which  the
state relies on statutory powers.

Civil law, in this context and not to be confused
with  the  civil  law  system  described  earlier,  is
the area of law that deals with disputes between

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

individuals  and/or  organizations,  in  which  com-
pensation or monetary damages may be awarded
to the victim.

This difference can be illustrated by the following
example.  A  bank  officer  embezzles  money  from
accounts under his control or supervision.

Under criminal law:

•  The officer could be charged and prosecuted
for theft as a crime defined by the legislation
of the jurisdiction in which the incident
happens. Under most legal systems, the
accused would not be required to testify
and would be entitled to a presumption
of innocence. The burden of proving guilt
would fall upon the prosecution, which must
usually meet a standard of guilt beyond
“reasonable doubt.”

•  In most common law and some civil law
systems, the accused is entitled to a jury
to try facts and determine guilt, although
he may waive that right and be tried by
the judge only.

•  Upon conviction, the accused (defendant)

may be subject to imprisonment, fines and
suspension of certain privileges, such as
special licensing or the ability to be hired by
a bank in the future. In some cases, the court
may order the defendant to pay restitution
or other compensation to the financial

pensated based on a percentage of the judgment
obtained. In a civil case, the plaintiffs do not have
the  resources  available  to  public  prosecutors,
and the cost of investigation and other technical
aspects of the case are either paid by the plaintiffs
or recovered through the proceeds of judgment.

PRIVATE VS. PUBLIC
INVESTIGATIONS
The  techniques  used  to  gather  evidence  vary
with the type of investigation — public or private
— and the jurisdiction. Generally, a public investi-
gation is conducted by a grand jury, law enforce-
ment  agency  or  a  government  regulatory  body.
Accordingly, it deploys all the powers and author-
ity granted by the government for such actions.

A  private  investigation  may  be  conducted  by  a
variety  of  private  sector  financial  crime  special-
ists  who  can  be  investigators,  forensic  accoun-
tants or lawyers, all of whom may be

supported  by  investigative  analysts,  whom  the
government  usually  calls  intelligence  analysts.
Although  the  government  usually  confers  no
investigative powers on these private sector indi-
viduals,  they  are  armed  with  powerful  weapons
under  the  equitable  powers  of  courts,  and  the
bankruptcy  and  insolvency  and  other  laws.  In
some instances, a private individual or firm may
be hired by a government agency to assist in an
investigation or file suit on its behalf.

Different  types  of  financial  crime  investigations
can be pursued depending on the jurisdiction and
the facts of the case. It is important to understand
these actions to know what types of investigative
approaches should be used in each situation.

institution or the account holders as victims.
The court may also, where allowed, order the
forfeiture of assets identified as proceeds of
the criminal activity.

In a civil case:

•  Aggrieved victims (as plaintiffs) would sue or
bring a legal action against the bank officer
(as defendant) for restitution.

•  In this type of proceeding, the victims need
only establish his case by a “preponderance
of evidence1” to win.

•  A jury trial may be available in common law

jurisdictions; however, in some jurisdictions,
a unanimous verdict is not always required.
If the plaintiff prevails, the court can order
the defendant to pay restitution and other
compensatory damages.

If you have the choice, consider the following fac-
tors  in  determining  whether  to  proceed  crimi-
nally or civilly in a case:

Criminal  prosecutions  are  driven  by  the  pros-
ecutor.  Although  the  victims  may  have  a  say  in
the  proceedings,  such  as  providing  testimony
and offering statements in support of sentencing,
the  prosecutor  has  ultimate  control  over  strat-
egy and tactics in the case. The costs of criminal
prosecutions  are  borne  by  the  government,  and
the prosecutor has a wide range of resources to
use in gathering evidence in support of the case.
In some civil law jurisdictions, a private party can
join in a criminal proceeding; this is not the prac-
tice under common law systems.

In  civil  proceedings,  victims  have  much  more
input  in  the  conduct  and  course  of  the  case.
Plaintiffs select and retain the attorney to repre-
sent  them.  However,  the  costs  are  the  responsi-
bility  of  the  plaintiffs,  except  in  some  situations
where legal counsel has undertaken the case on a
contingent fee basis. This means counsel is com-

1 Though it cannot be reduced to a formula, preponderance of evidence is generally understood to mean the level of evidence
needed to make it appear more likely than not that what a claimant seeks to prove is true.

INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES
There are countless investigative techniques that
can be used in financial crime cases. Often, it is
only  the  ingenuity  of  the  financial  crime  profes-
sional, including the investigator, forensic accoun-
tant, compliance officer, lawyer and investigative
analyst,  which  limits  the  investigative  approach
that may be applied in a challenging case.

The  following  lists  some  but  not  all  the  investi-
gative techniques and tools that may be used by
private  and  public  financial  crime  investigators,
along  with  the  benefits  and  restrictions  appli-
cable to each.

Compulsory  power  to  obtain  documents.  This
powerful  tool,  which  is  available  to  both  private
and  public  sector  investigative  teams  through
subpoenas,  requests  for  production  and  the  like,
compels production of records through an agency
summons,  a  grand  jury  subpoena  or  a  statute
providing  these  powers.  It  allows  the  investiga-
tor to follow money flows through bank accounts,
brokerage  companies,  asset  purchases,  nominee
owners,  shell  companies  and  private  individu-
als.  The  discovery  of  one  document  may  trigger
a  domino  effect  in  which  one  piece  of  evidence
flows directly to another lead and evidence.

The  analysis  of  bank  accounts,  for  instance,  is  a
three-step  process  that  can  lead  to  many  other
investigative angles:

1.  List, group and analyze all inflows (deposits)

of money. Follow the domino chain
backwards to determine the source of
each deposit and continue tracing until the
ultimate source of funds is identified.

2.  List, group and analyze all outflows (checks

or debits) of money from the account. Follow
the chain of the outflows until their ultimate
destination is determined. This may be the
purchase of multiple assets after the money
has passed through many accounts.

3.  Identify the balances in the account at

key moments, depending on the needs of

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

the investigation. For example, if a source
and application of funds analysis is being
prepared, then the beginning and ending
balances will be identified as part of this
computation.

Compulsory  power  to  obtain  testimony.  As
with  the  power  to  obtain  records  that  is  shared
by  public  and  private  sector  investigative  teams,
they can also -- in most jurisdictions -- take the
testimony  of  witnesses.  In  certain  cases,  gov-
ernment  investigators  and  lawyers  may  compel
testimony  of  witnesses  even  if  they  do  not  wish
to cooperate.

This testimony may explain records and transac-
tions,  clarify  relationships,  identify  leads,  estab-
lish  organizational  structures,  etc.  Records  and
documents do not speak for themselves and are
often  created  to  mislead.  Interviewing  skills  are
critical,  and  should  be  honed  by  all  members  of
a  public  and  private  sector  investigative  team
in order to enhance their ability to elicit crucial
facts and uncover relevant leads.

Telephone  wire  interception.  Public  sector  law
enforcement  agents  and  some  regulators  may
obtain  court  authorization,  based  on  probable
cause to intercept telephone conversations under
tightly  restricted  conditions.  These  recorded
conversations  can  provide  “smoking  gun”  evi-
dence in some cases.

Search  warrants.  Court  orders  are  required  for
search  warrants.  There  are  no  limits  to  the  evi-
dence that can be obtained by a well-drafted and
properly  executed  search  warrant  (the  evidence
seized  must  fall  within  the  four  corners  of  the
warrant).  The  seizure  may  be  financial  informa-
tion, videotapes, transaction records, contraband
or many other things.

Computer  seizures  and  evidence  recovery.
This  may  be  obtained  through  a  search  warrant
and  requires  special  computer  forensic  skills  to
ensure the recovery and admissibility of the evi-
dence. The investigator should always be mindful

153

of  the  chain  of  custody  requirements  in  seizing
and  safekeeping  an  item  for  presentation  as  evi-
dence in court.

Electronic  surveillance.  Any  surveillance  using
electronic  equipment  that  invades  the  expected
privacy  of  an  individual  usually  requires  a  court
order.  This  could  involve  eavesdropping  equip-
ment,  long-range  video  devices,  wireless  inter-
cepts,  etc.  In  most  jurisdictions  and  circum-
stances, a private sector investigator would not be
permitted to conduct these surveillances and uti-
lizing them could constitute a criminal violation.

Bi-national  and  International  Mutual  Legal
Assistance  Treaties  (MLAT)  and  less  formal
mutual assistance. Mutual legal assistance is the
process of requesting or providing evidence and
information from one country to another for use
in  a  criminal  investigation.  The  request  can  be
formal  or  informal.  A  formal  request  may  origi-
nate in an investigative agency in the requesting
country but must follow the procedures that the
requesting  country  specifies.  Usually  an  inter-
national  request  for  assistance  is  transmitted
through the country’s designated “National Cen-
tral  Authority,”  which  is  the  name  of  a  nation’s
office that coordinates international law enforce-
ment assistance with and through Interpol. In the
US,  the  National  Central  Authority  is  located  in
the US Department of Justice. The National Cen-
tral Authority, or Bureau as it is called in the US,
also often serves as the intermediary between a
nation’s law enforcement agencies and Interpol in
Lyon, France.

Requests  for  assistance  may  also  be  required  to
be  transmitted  through  diplomatic  channels  to
the  central  authority  of  the  “receiving  country”

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

and, finally, to a law enforcement authority in the
receiving  country,  to  undertake  the  requested
specified assistance. The assistance may include
obtaining  bank  records,  interviewing  witnesses,
executing  search  warrants  or  any  other  speci-
fied  investigative  or  evidence  gathering  proce-
dure. Generally, a formal mutual legal assistance
request  is  based  on  a  bilateral  or  multilateral
global or regional treaty, or a letter rogatory.

Undercover  operations.  In  public  sector  inves-
tigations,  an  undercover  operation  typically
requires  authorization  and  official  approval
before  it  can  be  started.  The  undercover  opera-
tion  may  continue  for  the  period  of  time  that  is
authorized. Undercover operations conducted by
the private sector must be mindful of the risk of
violating privacy laws.

Physical  surveillance.  Both  public  and  private
investigators  can  engage  in  surveillance  with
restrictions  and  advantages  for  each.  This  can
include examples such as tailing an investigative
subject  or  his  associates,  or  staking  out  a  loca-
tion  to  track  the  movements  of  a  target.  Sur-
veillance  can  help  locate  assets  (bank  accounts,
real  property,  brokerage  accounts,  boats,  cars,
etc.)  and  criminal  associates,  and  identify  pat-
terns of activity and establish probable cause for
search warrants.

Another  investigative  tool  is  garbage  pickups.
Properly conducted, garbage pickups can provide
considerable evidence and lead to hidden assets,
fronts  and  associates.  Law  enforcement  agen-
cies must ensure that information obtained from
both  surveillance  and  garbage  pickups  is  legally
admissible and that the process of obtaining the

MLATs are a key tool for law
enforcement in cross-border
investigations

information was proper in the jurisdiction where
the garbage pickup occurred.

police  actions,  or  national  Financial  Intelligence
Units (FIUs) of the Egmont Group.

Private  sector  investigators  should  also  be  on
firm ground concerning the legal requirements of
these  types  of  investigative  techniques  to  avoid
trespassing or other violations.

Informants.  Government  agency  investigations
have  strict  guidelines  for  the  use  of  informants,
while the private sector has few or no restrictions.
Informants  usually  request  anonymity,  which
may make their information inadmissible but still
a source of excellent leads and intelligence. Man-
datory disclosure to the defense in some jurisdic-
tions  may  complicate  the  use  of  informants  and
create evidentiary and security problems. Similar
problems  rarely  exist  for  the  private  sector.  The
risks  and  benefits  of  using  information  derived
from  informants  must  be  carefully  weighed  by
both sectors.

Recording  conversations  with  one  party  con-
senting.  Public  sector  investigators  can  obtain
authorization, often required from a court, before
recording conversations where one side consents.
This  is  a  significant  tool  in  obtaining  evidence
and is similar to a telephone intercept except that
the level of probable cause required to be shown
is  generally  less  stringent.  In  some,  but  not  all,
states  in  the  US,  a  private  sector  asset  recovery
team  member  may  record  a  conversation,  either
on the phone or in non-electronic circumstances,
when  one  party  to  the  conversation  consents.
Some jurisdictions allow this activity by non-gov-
ernment  entities,  while  others,  such  as  Florida,
make  it  a  criminal  violation.  Careful  research
of  the  law  in  the  jurisdiction  where  operating  is
essential in these situations.

Informal  international  assistance.  There  are
many  routes  of  productive  informal,  non-treaty,
international assistance that are available to pri-
vate  and  public  asset  recovery  team  members.
Examples  of  informal  MLA  requests  include  the
use  of  Interpol,  embassy  contacts,  police-to-

For example, the US FIU is the Financial Crimes
Enforcement  Network  (FinCEN)  Canada’s  is  Fin-
trac.  FIUs  generally  collect,  collate  and  analyze
substantial  amounts  of  financial  information,
much  of  which  is  derived  from  reporting  forms
that  the  financial  and  business  communities  of
a  nation  are  required  to  submit,  including  suspi-
cious activity reports.

Information  obtained  from  these  sources  may
serve  as  evidence  or  extremely  valuable  intelli-
gence  and  leads.  In  most  cases,  the  information
obtained  by  FIUs,  particularly  suspicious  activ-
ity  reports,  is  not  available  to  the  private  sector
directly  from  the  FIU,  but  may  often  be  subpoe-
naed  or  obtained  by  other  legal  process  from
the opposing party that filed a form. The private
sector  also  does  not  have  access  to  the  records
and assistance provided by Interpol, whose head-
quarters is in Lyon, France.

Civil  society  information.  Numerous  private
sector  organizations  that  serve  as  watchdogs,
such  as  Transparency  International,  Open  Soci-
ety Justice Initiative, Sherpa and Global Integrity,
employ  investigators,  forensic  accountants  and
attorneys  to  gather  evidence  and  intelligence
against  corrupt  leaders  and  politicians.  Occa-
sionally, they use this information in lawsuits to
recover assets for the victims of corrupt regimes.
Other times, the information is used for publica-
tions and offered to law enforcement and private
sector  investigators  to  help  bring  corrupt  offi-
cials to justice. This intelligence can be extremely
valuable  to  private  and  public  investigators.  The
private  sector  and  law  enforcement  can  use  the
information  as  intelligence  and  leads  to  assets.
Creating working relationships with these groups
is often very productive.

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

A  financial  crime  investigator  will  benefit  from
knowledge  in  search  engine  optimization  and
effective  searching.  The  exact  same  keyword
search  in  multiple  search  engines  will  gener-
ate  different  results  and  rankings.  Each  search
engine  uses  metadata  differently  and  will  often
rank  content  differently  when  delivering  the
results  of  an  online  search.  As  an  investigation
continues,  one  should  develop  a  list  of  search
engine keywords for investigations. The list could
include multiple aliases of a subject and names of
shell corporations.

The search engine industry has shifted from pro-
viding purely text content results to include other
results  in  searches,  such  as  videos  and  photos.
These  results  are  known  as  Blended  or  Univer-
sal  Search  Results  and  they  are  useful  to  finan-
cial  crime  investigators,  as  following  a  result  on
a  seemingly  irrelevant  photo  may  link  one  to  a
more  useful  content  page.  Effective  searching
investigation should include visually scanning and
checking images and video. Also, when checking
a page source, one should scan for comments that
are related to a video or image.

SOCIAL MEDIA, BLOGS AND
MICROBLOGGING
Social media sources can be extremely helpful in
a  financial  crime  investigation.  A  photo,  a  com-
ment  or  a  tweet  may  be  enough  to  establish  a
timeline  or  location  of  someone  that  may  be  of
interest. Social media is also an excellent source
of investigative information from people who may
be  observing  and  documenting  fraudulent  activ-
ity for distinct motives or a sense of duty.

Social  media  includes  sites  such  as  Facebook,
LinkedIn  and  LiveJournal.  Online  profiles  have
varying levels of security, but even a search that
generates  a  main  social  media  page  can  show
some  contacts  for  further  searching;  people  are
not  always  selective  about  “friending”  or  “con-
necting.”  Dating  sites  (eHarmony,  POF,  etc.)
often  have  online  discussion  boards  that  are

OPEN-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE
Open-source  intelligence  (OSINT)  is  informa-
tion  that  is  publicly  available  and  accessible;  yet
OSINT,  although  publicly  available,  is  not  neces-
sarily free or easily discoverable. OSINT gathering
will play a powerful role in most investigations. It
contributes to the foundation and justification for
more  intrusive  evidence  and  information  collec-
tion methods.

OSINT  does  not  require  a  court  order  to  obtain.
The  collection  techniques  used  for  OSINT  are
not intrusive.

There are several types of OSINT sources:

•  Online Searching and Web Content

•  Social Media, Blogs and Microblogging

•  Media Outlets and News Sources

•  Geospatial Open-Source

•  Public Records

•  Professional Conferences and Live Events

•  Observation and Reporting

ONLINE SEARCHING AND WEB CONTENT
A growing and easily accessible source of OSINT
is  Internet  searching  through  search  engines.
These are among the best known and frequently
used  online  tools  worldwide,  and  include  sites
such as Google, Bing and Yahoo.

open  and  searchable  with  or  without  an  online
dating account.

“Microblogging”  platforms  are  sites  where  users
share  and  contribute  short  messages  or  photo
and video content, such as Twitter, Tumblr, Face-
book,  Instagram  and  Pinterest.  Microblogging
can  be  a  powerful  and  extremely  fast  way  to
move  a  message.  Content  is  typically  generated
and buried quickly, and microblogging platforms
have tools to comment (or “like”), and share and
spread it. Depending on the audience, messages
can  be  transmitted  in  extreme  short-hand  or
particular  style  than  is  difficult  to  parse  if  you
are not the intended audience. Since users often
update  them  once  or  many  times  a  day,  microb-

logging and social media platforms can be useful
sources of real-time information about a subject.
In  more  than  one  case,  photos  and  other  infor-
mation posted to social media sites have helped
to track and locate suspected financial criminals.

MEDIA OUTLETS AND NEWS SOURCES
The media are powerful sources of open-source
information. A financial crime specialist will want
to  research  beyond  the  media  releases  that  are
freely available from search engine results. Media
includes newspapers, journals and other publica-
tions, and radio and television broadcasts. Some
of  the  major  online  newspapers  require  online
subscriptions  to  access  their  material,  which
may require a fee but will be more effective than

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: FINDING MARY
•  Names of relatives

Commercial record databases have evolved to
where  almost  all  public  information  is  availa-
ble online. Hundreds of websites now provide
access to this information, some at no cost and
others  for  a  nominal  fee.  To  test  the  ease  of
acquiring this information, a person with aver-
age  search  engine  capabilities  was  asked  to
locate a person and find as much information
as possible in 30 minutes. The person was pro-
vided  with  a  name,  an  approximate  age,  and
three possible cities of residence. We will call
the person Mary.

Within  the  allotted  time,  the  following  infor-
mation was found on the Internet at no charge:

•  Mary’s current and previous

two addresses

•  The current value of her house

•  A map of the house including aerial views

•  The names of her neighbors

•  Her telephone number

•  A possible date of birth

•  Street level photos from all angles of the

front of her house

•  Photos of her with her grandchild

•  A corporation of which Mary was an officer

•  The corporation’s annual filing reports

This was the tip of the iceberg. If the researcher
had invested $9.95, the discovered information
would have quadrupled.

The advent of social media, such as Facebook,
LinkedIn, MySpace and others, has put invalu-
able  personal  information  at  every  financial
crime  specialist’s  fingertips.  Today,  people
post almost everything online, including infor-
mation  about  friends,  travel,  assets  or  even
their bank. Postings on Facebook, Twitter and
other social media exchanges range from daily
activities  to  personal  pictures,  making  them
crucial resources for investigations.

months.  Real  estate  ownership  in  the  US  is  reg-
istered at the county seat where the property is
located,  and  each  county  would  need  to  be  vis-
ited and the property records manually searched
through  mountains  of  handwritten  logs.  Today
this  same  search,  for  the  entire  US,  can  be  con-
ducted  in  minutes  from  the  desktop  computer
of  an  investigative  analyst,  investigator,  forensic
accountant or other financial crime specialist.

Here is a sampling of the information that can be
easily found through a simple Internet search:

searching a stack of newspapers. Online publica-
tions also often allow user comments, which can
lead to further resources.

•  Locations of people

•  Telephone numbers

 » Reverse phone number lookups

Radio  and  television  broadcasts  may  end  up,
legally or not, posted to other social networking
sites.  Most  of  the  main  US  broadcasting  compa-
nies  maintain  some  of  their  content  online  for
search  or  upon  request.  Access  to  the  full  con-
tent may require a subscription or fee and a good
Internet connection for streaming large files.

GEOSPATIAL OPEN-SOURCE
Geospatial information is the equivalent of a vir-
tual globe, such as GoogleMaps or Google Earth.
These  tools  display  advanced  information  and
update their content frequently.

While  the  data  will  not  be  real-time,  users  may
also  create  custom  maps  to  update  places  of
interest  and  obtain  other  information.  This  can
aid in tracking a subject’s activities by potentially
revealing  details  of  his  or  her  current  location
and helping an investigator review locations and
confirm  addresses.  Tools  such  as  Google  Maps
allow an investigator to get a good view of a loca-
tion, which can be very useful.

A  simple  example,  from  a  commercial  database
and a social media posting, can demonstrate the

power of these investigative inquires in financial
crime investigations.

Example  1:  An  informant  says  the  subject  of  an
investigation  was  divorced  two  years  ago,  but
the location is unknown. A commercial database
search reveals the county and state of the divorce.
A further inquiry discloses that there was a prop-
erty settlement agreement. A copy of this agree-
ment, obtained online for a fee, reveals two bank
accounts and a Mercedes-Benz vehicle, traced to
a  dealership.  Contact  with  the  Mercedes-Benz
dealership reveals a financial statement that dis-
closes  additional  bank  accounts  and  property.  A
simple  Internet  search  uncovered  more  than  $1
million in assets.

It should be noted that bank accounts are usually
found  by  tracing  financial  transactions  and  fol-
lowing each lead. There is no Internet or govern-
ment database of bank accounts.

Example 2: The wife of the subject of a financial
crime  investigation  has  just  posted  on  Facebook
that  she  is  very  happy  with  the  new  penthouse
vacation  home  that  her  husband  has  purchased

in  an  expensive  coastal  area.  The  husband  is  a
public  official  earning  a  mid-range  salary  and  is
suspected  of  taking  bribes  or  kickbacks.  A  for-
mer  friend  of  the  wife  disclosed  the  Facebook
posting.  A  commercial  database  search  reveals
no  property  owned  by  the  public  official  in  the
coastal town.

A subsequent Facebook posting by the wife states
that she is looking forward to a trip to their new
vacation home this weekend. A surveillance of the
wife  and  husband  Friday  evening  leads  investi-
gators  to  the  property.  County  records  indicate
the  vacation  home  is  in  the  name  of  a  shell  cor-
poration. Numerous investigative leads will follow
from here, including the tracing of money used to
purchase the property.

Meaningful  OSINT  collection  requires  creativ-
ity, time and monitoring of trends in online tools.
A  financial  crime  specialist  also  needs  a  deep
understanding of the industry or individual they
are researching to conduct productive searches.

INTERVIEWING TECHNIQUES
Few  skills  are  as  important  to  the  success  of  a
financial  crime  investigation  as  the  command  of
interviewing  techniques.  Understanding  the  dif-
ferent  types  of  these  techniques  and  their  pros
and cons is essential to the success of the inter-
view, especially in financial crime cases.

INTERVIEW VS. INTERROGATION
To  appreciate  the  art  of  interviewing  and,  in
particular,  financial  interviewing,  it  is  import-
ant  to  know  the  difference  between  interview-
ing  and  interrogating.  The  main  difference  is  in
the objective.

In  an  interrogation,  the  investigator  has  a  sin-
gle  objective:  To  learn  if  the  suspect  commit-
ted the crime or is responsible for another thing
the  investigator  is  seeking  to  prove  or  disprove.
If not, who did it? The investigator is looking for
confessions  and  admissions,  asking  simple  and

159

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

direct questions and expecting simple and direct
answers. The questioning is accusatory in nature.

In an interview, particularly a financial interview,
the  investigator  attempts  to  develop  a  rapport
with the witness and looks for detailed answers.
involves  systematically
Financial
questioning  individuals  with  knowledge  of  the
events, the people involved and the physical and
intangible evidence:

interviewing

•  Subject interview (custodial or non-
custodial). Custodial interviews by a
government investigator often require the
obligation to provide warnings about the
right to counsel. It is critical to document
the recitation of required warnings in the
country where the interview was conducted
and to remain aware of perceptions
regarding implied custody. The subject must
also understand his ability to walk away, if
any. In conducting a non-custodial interview,
it is important to consider and prepare for
the likelihood of obtaining incriminating
statements. Consider protections,
perceptions of custody and other factors in
charting your course of action.

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

be authenticated and the chain of custody
established. Any lead documents need to
be followed up, and certified copies must
be obtained. It is important to understand
the motivation of third-party witnesses,
and one must ensure that facts are not
selectively provided.

•  Interview of parties who are represented

and not represented by lawyers. In planning
to interview witnesses, cooperating
individuals and subjects, it is important to
understand and respect the attorney-client
relationship. Represented parties should
not be contacted directly, but only through
their attorneys, depending on the laws
of the jurisdiction. Failure to identify and
acknowledge legal representation can prove
devastating to one’s investigation and the
admissibility of evidence.

AFFIDAVITS
An affidavit is a written statement of the witness’
testimony, made under oath by the witness. It is
an  effective  tool  for  locking  down  testimony  of
potentially hostile or unreliable witnesses.

•  Interview of cooperating witness.

Keep in mind the following:

Cooperating persons can provide intimate
details about the actions, comments, records
and assets of a subject. It is important to
maintain transparency in negotiations
with a cooperating witness to prevent the
perception of a quid pro quo arrangement –
i.e., “tell me what I want to hear and I’ll give
you what you want or need.” Informants are
apt to manipulate facts and circumstances
to fit a current need. All statements
by cooperating individuals must be
corroborated.

•  Interview of non-cooperating witness.
Other third-party witnesses can provide
information, leads and documents. Properly
document all witness contacts and
statements. Any documents received must

•  The affidavit must be voluntary.

•  Attester must give oath before a person
having authority to administer the oath.

•  The affidavit is usually prepared by the

interviewer, but may be prepared by the
witness, providing it addresses all of the
necessary issues.

•  It may be constructed contemporaneously

at the time of the interview or prepared later
from the interview notes.

•  The person signing the affidavit must

sign each page and initial any changes or
corrections.

•  The affidavit must be signed by the person
taking the oath and (preferably) a witness.

RECORDED TESTIMONY
Recorded  testimony  may  be  obtained  through
depositions  or  question-and-answer  (Q&A)  ses-
sions.  A  deposition  is  testimony  taken  by  coun-
sel before trial in which the “deponent” answers
questions  under  oath.  The  deposition  is  often
undertaken  under  court  order  (subpoena)  and
recorded  by  a  stenographer  or  mechanical
recording device, or both. A lawyer, or sometimes
an  investigator,  poses  questions  to  the  depo-
nent or witness.

Remember that the following:

•  Obtaining recorded testimony usually

requires the consent of the witness. Consent
must be obtained before the recording device
is turned on and should be obtained again as
part of the recorded proceedings.

•  Although this is an effective technique

for locking down testimony of hostile or
uncooperative witnesses, copies of the
original recording are discoverable in many
jurisdictions. The interviewer’s demeanor,
recorded comments and method of eliciting
information are also recorded and subject to
attack by the opposing side in the case.

•  The taping should not be shut off once the
session begins. Any interruptions to the
recording should be explained before the
recorder is stopped (why) and after it is
resumed (what was discussed).

•  In most jurisdictions, the non-consensual
recording of a party to a live or telephone
conversation is illegal without a court order.

INTELLIGENCE VS. EVIDENCE
The  key  difference  between  intelligence  and
evidence  is  admissibility  in  court.  Intelligence
is  information  that  is  not  generally  admissible
because  it  does  not  prove  a  relevant  fact.  Gen-
erally,  its  source  or  the  manner  in  which  it  was
collected may not be revealed. Evidence is infor-
mation  that  meets  the  standards  of  reliability

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

according  to  the  rules  of  evidence  and  is  admis-
sible  in  court.  The  rules  of  evidence  governing
admissibility vary from country to country.

Intelligence takes several forms and comes from
a variety of sources:

•  Human intelligence, such as undercover
operatives, confidential informants and
eyewitnesses

•  Open-source intelligence, such as the

Internet, radio and television broadcasts, and
publications

•  Signals intelligence, which includes

electronic eavesdropping

Evidence  must  be  relevant  and  bear  some  rela-
tionship to the matter being litigated. It must be
material  and  directly  or  circumstantially  prove
or  disprove  some  part  of  the  matter  being  liti-
gated. It must be competent and meet legal rules
of admissibility.

Examples of evidence include the following:

•  Commercial records obtained by a subpoena
and introduced by the records custodian
of a company

•  The statements of a defendant, knowing
his right to counsel, made freely to a law
enforcement agent

•  Facts observed by law enforcement during a

legal surveillance, except hearsay

•  Official government records legally

submitted by the agency

•  Testimony of a witness at trial (Note: An

affidavit or other written witness statement
taken during the investigation is generally
not admissible by itself at trial)

Examples of intelligence and inadmissi-
ble evidence:

Example 1: An investigator obtains a non-consen-
sual recorded telephone conversation of a target
discussing  his  foreign  bank  accounts.  The  inter-

161

cept  was  conducted  without  a  court  order.  The
information  is  both  relevant  and  material  to  the
matter now being tried; however, because of the
way it was obtained, it is not admissible. In most
circumstances,  any  legally  obtained  information
received as a direct result of the illegal intercept
often  would  not  be  admissible  in  court  proceed-
ings either, under the so-called exclusionary rule2.

Example 2: A news article reports that the alleged
ringleader  of  a  fraud  scheme  has  a  shell  corpo-
ration  in  Panama.  This  is  good  intelligence,  but
is  not  considered  admissible  as  evidence  unless
introduced  by  someone  who  has  direct  knowl-
edge of the account.

FINANCIAL CRIME INVESTIGATIONS
ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS
Instances of large-scale corruption, money laun-
dering,  fraud  and  asset  recovery  often  require
assistance  from  other  nations  and  jurisdictions,
which  may  have  different  laws  on  collection  of
evidence,  taking  of  testimony,  investigative  pro-
cedures and the level of cooperation afforded to
other countries.

When seeking foreign assistance in a government
or  public-sector  case,  or  when  a  private  sector
financial  crime  team  seeks  to  obtain  records  in
another  country,  it  is  important  to  understand
the  procedures  that  must  be  followed  to  obtain
the required evidence. The following issues may
affect  the  admissibility  of  the  evidence  that  is
obtained in that fashion.

Testimony of witnesses. If the goal is to use tes-
timony  as  evidence  and  the  witness  will  not  be
available  to  attend  the  proceedings  in  the  home
country,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  correct
procedures  are  followed  during  the  interview  of
the witness to preserve the evidence for later use
in  trial.  It  is  necessary  to  understand  the  proce-
dures that the court will require to admit the tes-
timony of a witness questioned in a foreign juris-

2 This is often referred to as “fruit from the poison tree.”

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

diction.  Some  jurisdictions  require  that  counsel
for both sides be present during the questioning.
Others require the testimony to be taken before a
judge. One should learn what the rules are before
undertaking evidence- gathering.

Special investigative techniques. In government
cases, it is very important to know how evidence
will be obtained in the requested country if “spe-
cial investigative techniques” will be involved. The
jurisdiction  that  is  gathering  the  evidence  may
have a lower standard of probable cause to obtain
authorization for the use of invasive procedures,
such as wiretaps, search warrants and electronic
surveillance.  This  may  cause  the  evidence  to  be
ruled inadmissible when it is introduced in court
in the jurisdiction of the requesting country.

Dual  criminality.  In  a  government  financial
crime  case,  where  the  assistance  of  a  foreign
nation is requested, it is important to know if the
requested nation requires that the offense being
investigated  qualify  as  an  offense  in  both  juris-
dictions before assistance will be rendered.

For example, most countries criminalize income
tax evasion, but Switzerland does not. If a mutual
legal assistance request is sent to Switzerland for
evidence to be gathered in support of a criminal
income tax investigation, it will be denied.

One should keep the following considerations in
mind  when  considering  sending  a  request  to  a
foreign nation for assistance:

•  What does one need to ensure that the

information gathered in the foreign country
will be admissible as evidence when it is
transmitted?

•  What are the legal and statutory

requirements of the foreign country? For
example, if one is attempting civil asset
forfeiture (non-conviction based) and wants
assets frozen in a foreign jurisdiction, does

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

162

that country have laws that allow non-
conviction-based seizures and forfeitures?

•  Is one legally compelled to inform the

subject of the investigation of the assistance
being requested in the foreign country? For
example, obtaining testimony of witnesses
that the opposing side may not be able to
interview may result in the statements being
deemed inadmissible.

•  Will the subject of the investigation be
notified of the requested assistance by
the foreign authorities? Some countries
require the holder of a bank account to be
notified prior to the disclosure of records to
the government.

•  What level of probable cause is required to
authorize certain enforcement actions or
investigative techniques, such as searches
and seizures?

The best way to answer these questions is to con-
tact the proper authorities in the foreign country
prior  to  sending  a  formal  request  for  assistance.
Another source of helpful information may be the
appropriate legal or other attachés in the embas-
sies  of  one’s  country.  Requestors  should  always
follow  their  agency’s  internal  rules  and  proce-
dures in making contact with foreign authorities.
Often, a phone call to the appropriate person in
the  foreign  jurisdiction,  or  to  one’s  embassies
overseas, will provide answers to these questions,
save time and ensure that the evidence is admis-
sible at trial.

One  should  always  keep  in  mind  the  resources
of one’s embassies throughout the world and the
embassies  of  foreign  nations  in  your  country’s
capital  city.  The  US,  for  example,  has  embassies
or  missions  in  more  than  150  countries,  and,  in
Washington,  DC,  more  than  150  countries  have
embassies  or  missions  in  Washington,  DC.  All
these embassies have officers or attachés that are
capable  of  answering  pertinent  questions.  In  all
US  embassies,  for  example,  there  are  represen-
tatives  of  federal  investigative  agencies,  such  as

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation,  whose  rep-
resentatives in foreign embassies are called Legal
Attachés or “Legats.”

TAX AND SECRECY HAVENS
Although we covered these extensively in the Tax
Evasion and Enforcement Chapter, we will briefly
mention them here. Because of their obvious ben-
efits, tax and secrecy haven countries are favored
locations  of  tax  evaders,  fraudsters  and  other
financial  criminals  to  hide  unreported  income
and criminally derived proceeds.

Secrecy  havens  are  nations,  or
jurisdictions
within  nations,  that  typically  have  the  following
characteristics:

•  Few or no taxes

•  Lack of effective exchange of tax information

with foreign tax authorities

•  Lack of transparency in the operation of

legislative, legal or administrative provisions

•  No requirement for a substantive

local presence

•  Self-promotion as an offshore financial center

In  recent  years,  many  regions  or  countries  that
historically  had  reputations  as  secrecy  havens,
such as the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, have
taken steps to reform their financial systems and
introduce greater transparency. But new havens
have opened their doors, and some in unexpected
locations,  like  the  US  states  of  Delaware  and
Nevada. It is often very difficult to obtain useful
information on beneficial owners, accounts, legal
entities or companies in these secrecy havens.

This difficulty may arise because the jurisdiction
restricts  what  information  can  be  provided  in
investigations,  or  because  accurate  information
on account or business ownership is not collected
in the first place. Delaware, for example, does not
require any information on the true owners of a
corporation to be provided at time of incorpora-

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

US SECRECY HAVENS

In recent years, national governments of many
nations, as well as international bodies such as
the  FATF,  have  highlighted  the  need  for  cor-
porate  transparency  to  help  combat  money
laundering  and  tax  evasion.  Although  the  US
has  participated  in  these  calls  for  transpar-
ency,  critics  have  justifiably  highlighted  the
fact  that  the  country  plays  host  to  its  own
secrecy havens, in the form of states with very
lax incorporation laws.

Four US states in particular, Delaware, Nevada,
Oregon and Wyoming, have emerged as popu-
lar locations to form shell companies because
of the almost complete anonymity in the com-
pany  formation  process.  Delaware  is  most
notable  because  it  offers  very  low  taxes  and
minimal  requirements  for  maintaining  a  com-
pany after it is formed.

Most importantly, Delaware, along with several
other states, collects no information on bene-

ficial owners at the time of company formation.
Likewise, no information on the true owners of
companies is available from Delaware’s corpo-
rate registry. Delaware corporations that do not
actually  do  business  in  the  state  of  Delaware
do not need to file annual income tax reports
or company financial statements, allowing the
company’s financial records to remain private.
The  state  also  allows  for  company  formation
agents  to  conduct  incorporation,  and  for  the
company  to  be  held  in  the  name  of  nominee
directors and shareholders.

Despite  the  increasing  attention  and  public
outcry over the role of US states like Delaware
as  secrecy  havens,  to  date  these  states  have
resisted  calls  for  increased  transparency  and
stricter customer identification procedures. It
should be noted that the vast majority of com-
panies incorporated in Delaware and the other
states highlighted are entirely legitimate.

tion, leading investigators to dead ends when they
pursue a source to a shell corporation formed in
that  state.  More  information  on  secrecy  havens
is  provided  in  the  Tax  Evasion  and  Enforcement
chapter of this Manual.

•  Open-source intelligence

•  Financial documents

•  Other related documents

•  Employee interviews

INFORMATION SOURCES FOR A
FINANCIAL CRIME INVESTIGATION
Once  a  financial  crime  investigation  begins,  a
financial  crime  specialist  should  start  with  the
least intrusive methods possible and conduct lim-
ited initial interviews and discussions with people
least close to the suspected financial crime. This
will  strengthen  the  information  in  hand  before
talking  to  the  person  or  persons  directly  impli-
cated in the financial crime. Information sources
that are available include the following:

•  Whistleblowers or anonymous tips

•  Physical property and assets search

•  Information on company structure, directors

and ownership

COOPERATING DEFENDANTS
Cooperating  persons  are  usually  prompted  by
similar  motivations  as  informants.  They  may
be  seeking  to  avoid  prosecution,  or  seeking  a
lenient  sentence  after  conviction.  They  are  look-
ing  to  “cut  a  deal”  or  gain  favor  in  exchange  for
information or testimony. They can provide valu-
able  information  on  financial  transactions  and

164

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

movements  of  targets  and  their  accomplices.
They  may  also  identify  co-conspirators  and  law-
yers,  accountants  and  other  “gatekeepers”  who
assisted in purchasing, moving and hiding funds
and  other  assets.  They  can  also  identify  the  ori-
gin  and  true  ownership  of  assets  derived  from
financial  crime.  They  may  also  be  able  to  inter-
pret books and records.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Financial  documents  are  not  limited  to  finan-
cial  statements  but  can  include  other  financial
records, such as receipts, checks and checkbook
ledger  and  bank  records.  Financial  documents
provided or made available by an entity normally
require no court order. Many financial documents,
such as an employee’s personal bank statements,
require a court order if the employee is not willing
to provide them voluntarily. A selection of some of
the most important and common financial docu-
ments  will  be  covered  in  detail  later  in  the  next
chapter, Interpreting Financial Documents.

RELATED DOCUMENTS
Important  information  about  the  culture  of  a
business entity, including the financial condition
and direction or pressure from management, may
be  learned  from  documents  that  are  not  neces-
sarily of a financial nature. A financial crime spe-
cialist  should  ask  to  see  an  ethics  statement  for
the company, as well as human resources policies
and  employee  contracts.  If  these  documents  do
not exist, ask why.

Another  useful  document  might  be  the  internal
bulletin  that  gives  a  sense  of  the  management
tone and style. If the company is publicly traded
and has to file with the appropriate regulator, one
should  review  not  only  the  financial  documents
that were filed, but also the auditor’s report and
other  written  statements  and  footnotes  associ-
ated with the financial filings and annual reports.

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

EMPLOYEE INTERVIEWS
When planning employee interviews, one should
start with the employees furthest removed from
the potential financial crime but who are still able
to  provide  helpful  background  information  or
potential leads.

A private company may have its own regulations
concerning employee cooperation in an internal
investigation, but it may not conflict with national
or  local  law.  Private  company  regulations  may
include termination for not cooperating during a
financial crime investigation.

EMPLOYER-PROVIDED MATERIALS
If the cooperating entity in an investigation is an
employer, it can usually provide employee e-mails,
phone logs and computer usage without employee
permission and knowledge. The e-mail server log
can be useful to show outgoing attachments from
an employee’s e-mail and their file sizes.

The  materials  that  may  be  disclosed  in  investi-
gations may depend on the laws and regulations
of  the  jurisdiction  where  the  investigation  takes
place,  as  well  as  the  terms  of  the  employment
contract. Investigators should consult legal coun-
sel  if  there  is  a  question  whether  it  is  legal  and
advisable  to  obtain  and  use  employee  records
without consent.

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
A financial crime specialist should know the legal
process and laws of his or her jurisdiction before
and  during  the  investigation.  Even  if  the  investi-
gation is not part of a legal action, it must be doc-
umented properly. Documentation should be pre-
served due to the possibility of a legal proceeding.

An  initial  investigation  may  develop  into  a  crim-
inal investigation if it is discovered that criminal
activity  has  taken  place  or  is  in  progress.  Law

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

enforcement  involvement  may  make  it  easier  to
obtain  some  evidence,  such  as  personal  finan-
cial  documents,  for  review.  These  legal  requests
typically  go  through  the  court.  Evidence  seized
pursuant  to  a  court  order  must  be  obtained
within the scope of the court order if it is to be
used at trial.

Law enforcement agents, usually through a pros-
ecutor, can request search warrants from a judge,
who  may  issue  them  with  specific  rules  for  seiz-
ing and searching the evidence. A search warrant
specifies  the  time,  place  and  items  that  can  be
searched. Failure to follow the terms of the search
warrant may render the evidence useless in trial.

intelligence

Exhaustive  open-source
(OSINT)
work  and  client  cooperation  can  lay  the  founda-
tion  of  an  investigation  if  criminal  activity  has
not  yet  been  determined.  Overt,  open  and  non-
intrusive evidence gathering will help determine
if an investigation needs to be escalated to a legal
action.  This  will  also  strengthen  the  case  made
to  a  judge  in  requesting  a  court  order  for  more
intrusive investigation.

COURT ORDERS
If  a  financial  crime  specialist  has  been  retained
by an employer to conduct an investigation, he or
she will probably have substantial access to files
and  physical  property,  including  the  employee’s
computer, electronic data and phone records.

A  private  sector  financial  crime  specialist  may
also be engaged after a law enforcement agency
has  begun  an  investigation.  Evidence  may  have
already  been  seized  and  removed  from  the  ini-
tial placement location before the private sector
financial crime specialist ever comes on the scene.

Regardless of the sequence of events, if an inves-
tigator  needs  a  court  order  to  preserve,  obtain,
search  and  protect  information,  he  or  she  will
likely  need  the  support  of  the  court  and  law
enforcement agents to get it. Legal counsel should
be consulted once criminal activity in the matter
has been established.

SEARCH WARRANT
As  an  investigation  grows,  a  financial  crime  spe-
cialist  may  need  access  to  property  and  doc-
uments  to  which  a  person  has  a  reasonable
expectation of privacy and is not willing to grant
permission to access them.

For a judge to approve a search warrant request,
he  or  she  must  be  shown  probable  cause  that  a
suspect  has  participated  in  the  criminal  activity
or committed a crime.

SUBPOENA
The  subpoena  is  the  legal  tool  most  commonly
used to obtain information. It is a legally enforce-
able command for a specified person or entity to
produce records or things at a specified place at
a specified time, either with or without accompa-
nying testimony. A subpoena may be issued by a
clerk of court in connection with a legal proceed-
ing; an attorney in connection with many national
and state court proceedings; and, in some cases,
by  law  enforcement  officials  and  administrative
agencies  in  connection  with  their  investigations
and proceedings.

During  a  criminal  investigation  in  many  coun-
tries,  a  grand  jury  reviews  the  evidence  and
decides  if  the  case  will  go  to  trial.  Further  evi-
dence  may  be  requested  on  behalf  of  the  court
through subpoenas.

There  is  considerable  variation  in  the  subpoena
process from country to country and even within
states and jurisdictions of certain countries. Gen-
erally, a subpoena is a blank document issued by
the court clerk to be filled out by an attorney and
then served by law enforcement agents.

Individuals  or  entities  that  fail  to  comply  with  a
subpoena may be held in contempt of court, which
may  include  monetary  penalties  or  jail  depend-
ing on the jurisdiction. Individuals or entities are
subject to the terms of the subpoena unless they
can prove that they do not have to comply with it.

166

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 8 • FINANCIAL CRIME  INVESTIGATIONS

The subpoena process is not necessarily as fast as
that of the search warrant. A search warrant for
public sector agencies may be preferable if infor-
mation must be seized immediately.

PRESERVATION ORDERS (LITIGATION
HOLD, HOLD ORDERS)
A  financial  crime  specialist  conducting  an  inves-
tigation may find he or she needs to protect elec-
tronic  data  from  being  deleted,  altered  or  oth-
erwise “spoliated.” Due to the ephemeral nature
of electronic data, which can be easily erased or
overwritten  intentionally  or  accidentally,  cap-
turing and preserving such evidence can pose a
real challenge.

Some  electronic  data,  by  nature,  is  overwritten
quickly  while  some  persists  until  a  decision  is
made  to  overwrite  it.  It  is  important  to  under-
stand  what  evidence  can  be  overwritten,  and
take  the  appropriate  steps  to  preserve  it  until  a
cyber-investigation is conducted.

Once  important  electronic  material  has  been
located,  it  may  be  wise  to  seek  a  “protective”
order to prevent a party from accessing, destroy-
ing, overwriting or modifying it. “Litigation holds”
may also be imposed internally by companies that
reasonably anticipate litigation or by an attorney
working  for  an  adversary.  They  are  mechanisms
to preserve data while the legal issue is addressed
and resolved.

CHAPTER 9

INTERPRETING
FINANCIAL
DOCUMENTS

A financial crime specialist needs to interpret and handle finan-

cial documents as if they will be used in a legal case. During the

investigation, it may be hard to know what will be relevant, so

you must treat all documents as relevant evidence. This includes

maintaining the proper chain of custody and documentation.

A financial crime specialist should have working knowledge of

the industry related to the financial records he or she is exam-

ining, or consult an expert that does. Knowing the industry will

make  persons  more  effective  in  recognizing  the  red  flags  in

the documents.

168

FINANCIAL CRIME VERSUS ERROR
One  primary  factor  that  distinguishes  fraud
from error is whether the underlying action that
results in the misstatement of the financial state-
ments is intentional or unintentional.

Consider  the  overall  accounting  environment
when  reviewing  financial  statements  for  red
flags  of  financial  crime.  A  financial  crime  spe-
cialist  should  review  for  the  proper  applica-
tion  of  accounting  principles  and  for  changes  in
accounting  estimates  or  accounting  principles.
Although they will not be reviewed in detail here,
the financial crime specialist should have at least
an introductory knowledge of “generally accepted
accounting  principles,”  or  GAAP,  in  the  jurisdic-
tion  in  which  the  entity  under  review  operates.
There  is  no  current  internationally  used  system
of accounting principles, although many nations
have adopted the International Financial Report-
ing Standards.

When  looking  for  red  flags,  the  culture  of  the
entity  under  review  is  an  important  guide  and
possible  source  of  information.  Observation  of
the tone of the company and the division of duties
provide  important  background  information  as
financial documents are collected and analyzed.

Financial reporting fraud may include
the following:

•  Manipulation

•  Misrepresentation

•  Misapplication

Financial  reporting  fraud  can  also  be  a  result  of
“earnings  management,”  as  opposed  to  a  larger
criminal conspiracy. Regardless of the reasoning
behind the financial reporting fraud, there can be
significant  implications  to  investors  that  rely  on
this  information,  as  well  as  the  employees,  and
the  overall  financial  health  of  the  entity.  Fraud-
ulent  financial  reporting  can  also  mislead  busi-

ness partners, vendors and financial institutions
about loans by representing an inaccurate finan-
cial picture.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS)
The
International  Financial  Reporting
Standards  (IFRS)  are  a  uniform,  inter-
national
language  for  accounting  and
recording  business  transactions.  They
are  designed  to  allow  company  accounts
to  be  understood  and  compared  across
international  boundaries.  The  IFRS  have
been  developed  in  response  to  increas-
ing  globalization  and  international  trade,
and  they  are  particularly  significant  for
companies with a multinational presence.
While  their  adoption  has  been  gradual  in
many jurisdictions, they are progressively
replacing  the  many  different  national
accounting  standards,  such  as  “gener-
ally  accepted  accounting  principles,”  or
GAAP,  in  the  US.  The  rules  are  to  be  fol-
lowed  by  accountants  to  maintain  books
of accounts which are comparable, under-
standable, reliable and relevant to review-
ers internally or externally.

IFRS  began  in  the  European  Union  as  a
way  to  create  an  EU-wide  accounting
standard.  However,  the  value  of  harmoni-
zation  quickly  made  the  concept  attrac-
tive  around  the  world.  They  are  some-
times  still  called  by  the  original  name  of
International  Accounting  Standards  (IAS).
The  development  and  implementation  of
the  IFRS  is  led  by  the  international  orga-
nization  the  Board  of  the  International
Accounting Standards Committee (IASC).

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

UNDERSTANDING AND USING
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
From  a  business  and  investment  standpoint,
financial statements offer a view of a company’s
performance and financial health for a particular
period of time. For the financial crime investiga-
tor,  financial  statements  should  be  viewed  as  a
source of leads to do the following:

•  Specific financial transactions that could
form the basis of violations of criminal
and civil law

•  Civil and criminal recovery or

forfeiture of assets

•  Civil torts committed against a specific

party or parties

In  short,  the  financial  crime  investigator’s  job  is
to discover the story behind the numbers.

The type of financial crime or wrongdoing must
be  taken  into  account  when  analyzing  financial
statements. If the alleged criminal act is the laun-
dering  of  criminal  proceeds  through  a  company,
the  financial  crime  investigator  will  be  look-
ing for an infusion of money into the company’s
bank accounts through new sources, or spikes in
the following:

•  Revenues

•  Loans from officers or third parties

•  Inclusions of assets with no corresponding

outflow of funds

Properly  kept  books  and  records  should  provide
the  financial  crime  specialist  with  an  audit  trail
to the persons responsible for the entries in the
books  and  records.  They  will  also  lead  to  the
persons  responsible  for  the  classification  of  the
entries and those responsible for the activity. The
financial  crime  specialist  must  follow  the  funds
through  the  books  and  records  and  document

their  origins,  forms  and  destinations,  as  well  as
the related source documents.

 TYPES OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The  ability  to  understand  bank  and  other  finan-
cial  records  is  a  critical  skill  in  financial  crime
and asset recovery work. Banks and other finan-
cial  institutions  keep  various  types  of  records,
file various forms with government agencies, and
undertake various services for customers. These
practices  generate  information  and  records  that
may  prove  invaluable  to  financial  crime  mat-
ters.  Similarly,  forensic  accountants  and  finan-
cial crime investigators use and analyze financial
records to identify witnesses, leads, evidence and
assets. They also use financial records as evidence.

INCOME STATEMENT OR STATEMENT
OF EARNINGS (PROFIT AND LOSS)
An organization’s profit and loss (P&L) statement3
is  a  calculation  and  display  of  its  financial  per-
formance  for  a  specified  time  period,  usually  a
specific  year.  It  is  important  to  note  that  a  P&L
statement always represents a period of time (as
opposed  to  a  balance  sheet,  which  represents  a
single moment in time).

Revenue sources and amounts are listed, often in
general terms. Depending on the type of business,
the “Cost of Goods Sold” (COGS) will be deducted
to arrive at gross profit. Expenses, again probably
in general terms, will be deducted to arrive at net
profit from business operations. In its most basic
sense, a P&L statement is just a statement of rev-
enue minus expenses to determine profit.

As  a  financial  crime  investigator,  a  quick  analy-
sis of the profit and loss statement can serve as
a  pointer  system  to  get  you  started  in  where  to
begin the analysis of the organization’s books and
records. It is often instructive to compare “P&Ls”

a profit and loss statement (P&L), revenue statement, statement of financial performance, earnings statement, operating

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

over  several  periods  to  look  for  unusual  fluctua-
tions. Following are some questions that financial
crime investigators should ask:

•  The top section will show revenue and cost

of sales4, and the result of the revenue minus
the cost of sales which is the ‘Gross Profit.’

•  Are there any sources of income that appear
out of the ordinary, or inordinately high, for
the company or the industry?

•  Is the Cost of Goods Sold within industry

standards? Are there items in Cost of Goods

•  Sold that don’t seem to be connected to the
production process? In the US, due to some
Tax Court decisions, questionable payments
are placed in Cost of Goods Sold rather than
deducted below as operating expenses.

•  Is the gross profit too high a percentage for

industry standards?

•  Are business expenses delineated, and, if so,
are there indications of where fraudulent
expenses may be concealed?

•  Are there unusual fluctuations in any
of the revenue or expense categories
between periods?

Profit and loss statements can be limited by items
omitted  (examples  are  values  such  as  brand  rec-
ognition  that  have  no  established  guidelines  for
measuring); by accounting methods used to pro-
duce the numbers (companies in the same indus-
try may use different depreciation methods); and
by measurements that involve judgment (such as
life  of  an  asset,  or  estimates  of  future  bad  debt
write-offs). You should always be aware of indus-
try norms when analyzing statements.

In the following example of a P&L, you can see the
primary  elements  of  a  typical  statement.  Every
company will have a slight variation of this as far
as  specific  line  items—sometimes  far  more  gran-
ular,  and  sometimes  less—but  all  will  have  three
basic sections:

•  The next section will show all expenses

and derive a sum of expenses. It will then
subtract the expenses from the gross profit
to determine the ‘Income from Operations.’

•  And finally, at the bottom, usually after
a section for other income and/or non-
operating expenses (such as taxes), will
be the ‘Net Profit (or Loss).’ This is simply
derived from the Income from Operations
and adding any other income and subtracting
and non- operating expenses.

Formatting  and  line  items  will  be  different  in
every P&L you see, but, in the end, it is simply a
statement  of  revenue  minus  expenses  to  deter-
mine net profit or loss for the year.

In  the  example,  you  should  notice  that  a  great
deal  of  the  information  on  the  statement  is
derived  from  other  data  on  the  sheet.  To  clar-
ify what data is derived from other entries; rows
that  are  used  in  calculations  are  labeled  with  a
letter  label.  For  example,  Total  Sales  Revenue  is
labeled with a [J]. For derived results, the formula
to  determine  that  row’s  value  is  included  in  the
row. For example, ‘Gross Profit’ is the result of [J]
minus [K], and we will now refer to gross profit as
[L]. In other words, gross profit is the total sales
revenue minus the total cost of sales.

To  further  clarify  the  statement,  you  should
notice that all ‘cells’ that are calculated from other
data  and  not  manually  entered  are  shaded  grey.
Any changes to entered data in the non- shaded
cells  should  automatically  change  the  results  in
the shaded cells.

In our example, there are additional columns for
‘Current  Period  as  a  %  of  Sales’  and  ‘%  Change
from Prior Period.’ You will not always see these
on  a  P&L,  but  we  include  them  here  to  demon-

strate some of the conclusions you can draw from
the data in our example.

The  first  column  of  those  two  columns  is  sim-
ply  the  entry  in  that  row  for  the  current  period
divided by the total sales revenue for the current
period,  which  in  our  example  is  $400,0005.  We
can clearly see in this column that software sales
were 32.5% of total revenue in 2012.

The  final  column  simply  shows  the  percentage
change in that row from the prior period to the
current  period.  This  should  highlight  any  signif-
icant  year  over  year  changes.  For  example,  the
cost of supplies increased 100 percent in 2012, or
doubled year over year. Granted, the numbers are
small in this example (only increasing from $2,000
to  $4,000),  but  should  highlight  the  kind  of  year
over year changes that should catch your eye.

What  can  you  determine  from  this  statement?
Usually,  any  issues  will  require  making  an  anal-
ysis  of  the  results  to  determine  what  might  be
suspicious depending on what you are investigat-
ing. On this statement, a financial crime specialist
may  want  to  look  into  why  the  cost  of  sales  for
software increased by 50 percent from one year
to the next, but the revenue from software sales
only increased 30 percent. There may be a simple

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

and easily explained reason for this, but it shows
you  the  kind  of  item  that  might  warrant  more
investigation.

Charitable  organizations  do  not  produce  a  P&L
statement.  Charities,  by  definition,  are  not
for  profit,  and  thus  will  have  not  profit  or  loss.
However,  they  often  do  have  reporting  require-
ments,  either  to  a  regulator,  donors  or  a  board
of directors.

Instead,  they  produce  a  similar  statement  that
reflects  funding  sources  compared  against  pro-
gram  expenses,  administrative  costs,  and  other
operating  commitments.  This  statement  is  com-
monly referred to as the statement of activities.

Although not depicted in our example, most P&L
statements  from  companies  of  any  significant
size  include  a  Notes  section  at  the  end.  As  with
any  financial  statement,  the  Notes  section  is
common place to hide irregularities.

Some  questionable  entries  in  the  Notes  section
might include the following:

•  Write-downs of inventories

•  Litigation settlements

•  Discontinued operations

•  Disposal of assets such as property, plants

and equipment

•  Disposals of investments

•  Restructurings activities of an entity

•  Other reversals of provisions

Once  again,  this  manual  will  not  make  you  an
accounting  expert,  but  you  should  be  familiar
with P&L statements and the red flags that might
require further investigation.

5 Note that the actual entry in that row is 400, but at the top of the statement you should notice that all numbers are ‘stated in
000s.’ That simply means the statement is in thousands, and you should add three zeros to the end of all numbers on the state-
ment to get the actual number. This is a common practice to reduce the clutter on a P&L statement.

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

BALANCE SHEET (STATEMENT OF
FINANCIAL POSITION)
As  we  mentioned  in  the  P&L  section,  an  entity’s
balance  sheet  shows  information  on  assets  and
liabilities for a single point in time. It is, in essence,
a net worth statement for a company.

The  balance  sheet  should  reflect  the  balancing
equation:  Assets  =  Liabilities  +  Owner’s  Equity.
Alternatively, you can look at it as the difference
between  assets  and  liabilities  equals  owner’s
equity,  or  Assets  -  Liabilities  =  Owner’s  Equity.
Please  note  that  owner’s  equity  is  not  always  a
positive number; a company that is in trouble may
have more liabilities than assets.

Assets are usually listed in order of liquidity with
the  most  liquid  assets  being  listed  first  starting
with current assets. Similarly, liabilities are listed
from  short  term  to  long  term.  Owner’s  equity
follows  the  liability  and  loosely  is  listed  in  order
of liquidity.

The  financial  crimes  investigator  can  also  use
a  company’s  balance  sheet  to  locate  potential
leads  to  various  financial  criminal  transactions.
Like  the  profit  and  loss  statement,  fluctuations
between periods will often be a key to uncovering
these hidden transactions. Some of the things to
look for include the following:

•  Transfers of assets to Special Purpose

Entities (SPEs: off-balance sheet entities)

•  Personal assets of corporate officers carried

on the books of the organization

•  Apparent manipulation of the

organization’s stock price to meet market
analysts’ forecasts

The example balance sheet shows the three main
sections  clearly:  assets,  liabilities  and  owner’s
equity  (sometimes  referred  to  as  shareholder’s
equity).  Although  a  balance  sheet  represents  a
moment in time, there may be multiple moments
in time depicted on a balance sheet to show the
change over time. This is typical with a year-end
statement.  In  our  example,  the  balance  sheet
shows the company status on three specific days:
December  31  of  2012,  2011  and  2010.  This  allows
us  to  compare  the  same  moment  in  the  year
between several years.

The  assets  section  begins  with  current  assets.
These  are  defined  as  assets  that  will  mature  in
less than a year or can be liquidated in less than
a year. Healthy companies typically have a strong
current asset position that can cover all of their
short-term liabilities, often with a surplus.

The current assets in our example:

•  Cash and Cash Equivalents – Basically the

•  An influx of cash or other liquid assets from

company’s cash position

non-revenue sources

•  Accounts receivable on the books that don’t

correspond to sales and revenues

•  Inventory valuations that don’t correspond to
import or export valuations (a sign of trade-
based money laundering)

•  A significant amount of “goodwill” (see next

page) from acquisitions

•  Appearance of asset valuations that don’t
correspond to outlays of cash and/or
loans payable

•  Suspicious loans and other transactions

with principals

•  Short Term Investments – Investments that
will mature in less than a year or that are
intended to be liquidated within a year. If
a company has a strong cash position, it
will likely also have significant short-term
investments which will yield a higher return
than cash or cash equivalents but are still
reasonably liquid.

•  Net Receivables – Outstanding payments

expected from customers less the amount
expected to be uncollectable

•  Inventory – The value of inventory currently

in stock but not sold yet

uncommon for this to fluctuate over time,
but massive changes should be looked into.

for assets not covered elsewhere.

As  with  the  asset  section,  the  liability  section
begins  with  current  liabilities,  or  liabilities  that
will come due in less than a year.

Below  the  current  assets  are  the  fixed  assets
of  the  company.  These  assets  are  considered
less liquid:

The  current  liabilities  in  our  example  include
the following:

•  Accounts Payable. These are the bills owed by

•  Long Term Investments. These are

investments that the company intends to
hold for more than a year and might never
mature. Stock positions in other companies
and bonds might fall in this category.

•  Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E).
This represents relatively illiquid assets
a company might hold and, without
reinvestment over time, will decrease due to
depreciation. It may be a very large item for
some types of companies or a very small line
item for others6.

•  Goodwill. This is a line item typically found

when a company acquires another company.
In order to balance the books, this is added
as an asset to reflect any premium paid
over the book value of the company7. It is
intended to reflect the intangible assets that
are considered part of the purchase, such
a brand value or reputation of the acquired
company. Although there was likely a clear
reason the company paid over book value
for an acquisition, goodwill is generally not a
good thing to have on the books.

•  Intangible Assets. Assets that are not

physical in nature, such as patents and other
intellectual property. Intangible assets are
typically very hard to value and could be
inflated on some balance sheets.

•  Short/Current Long-term Debt. Short-term
debt is debt that will come due in less than
a year, and current long-term debt is the
payment due on long-term debt with a year.

•  Other Current Liabilities. As in the asset

section, these are liabilities that are not large
enough to qualify as line items. It is a catchall
for small, miscellaneous liabilities.

As a general rule, in a healthy company, the cur-
rent liabilities should not be greater than the cur-
rent  assets.  Below  the  current  liabilities  are  the
long-term  liabilities  the  company  carries.  These
are liabilities that will not mature in the next year.

a balance sheet. This reflects an acquisition
where less than the book value was paid, or

owns. A consulting company would likely have a small number in this line item.

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

acquisition was worth. This typically happens
in distressed sales or a sale in which the
assets of the company being acquired are
very illiquid.

•  Other Liabilities. This is another catchall

category that covers liabilities that are not
covered in another line item.

Balance  sheets  in  particular,  are  very  indus-
try-specific.  While  all  will  have  the  general  line
items found here, there will be industry variances.

There  are  many  ways  a  balance  sheet  can  be
manipulated.  One  example  is  the  early  recogni-
tion  of  assets.  Assets  with  long-term  contingen-
cies,  or  that  cannot  be  billed  in  the  near  future,
can  be  recognized  early.  These  assets  could  be
placed  in  the  “accounts  receivable”  account  in
order to push up revenue for a given period.

This  is  inaccurate  because  the  sale  of  a  long-
term  asset  beyond  a  year  would  be  inappropri-
ately  classified  if  put  in  the  accounts  receivable
account. Consequently, unusually large accounts
receivable  on  a  balance  sheet  for  a  given  period
should  rouse  the  interest  of  a  financial  crime
investigator.

This  is  only  one  example.  There  are  many  oth-
ers, such as moving assets from PP&E to current
assets  if  they  are  intended  to  be  sold  within  a
year  even  though  the  sale  may  never  happen  or
the valuation may be inflated and not reflective of
the likely sale price. You need to review balance
sheets with a critical eye to discern discrepancies.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
The  statement  of  cash  flows  presents  the  use
of  cash  and  cash  generated  in  a  defined  period
of  time  (fiscal  year  ending,  quarter  ending,  etc.).
It  will  be  broken  into  three  categories:  opera-
tion  activities,  investing  activities  and  financ-
ing activities.

Although usually issued regularly like the income
statement,  the  statement  of  cash  flows  shows
actual  cash  items  only,  while  the  income  state-
ment (P&L) shows non-cash items such as depre-
ciation. These are typically produced quarterly by
most companies depending on the requirements
of the jurisdiction’s regulator.

A  statement  of  cash  flows  is  a  critical  piece  of
information  to  review  to  truly  determine  the
health  of  the  company  and  to  note  any  irreg-
ularities.  There  are  many  ways  to  manipulate
an  income  statement  to  appear  very  liquid  or
profitable,  yet  the  company’s  cash  position  is
extremely poor.

An  example  would  be  if  a  company  wins  a  large
contract with a very big customer. On the income
statement, it would be recognized as revenue, but
they might not get paid for the contract for quite
some time. A more accurate look into a company’s
liquidity  should  include  a  review  of  their  State-
ment of Cash Flows.

OTHER TYPES OF
FINANCIAL RECORDS
In  addition  to  the  usual  statements  that  most
companies  are  required  to  prepare,  there  are
myriad other documents retained that might lead
to solving or discovering a financial crime.

TRANSACTION RECORDS
Transaction records kept by financial institutions
can  produce  invaluable  information.  Transac-
tion  records,  such  as  those  that  follow,  are  just
the beginning of what one can find in a commer-
cial bank or credit union, otherwise known as a
depository institution:

•  Deposit tickets

•  Deposited items (checks and other monetary

instruments)

•  Checks drawn

•  Debit memos

•  Credit memos

•  Outgoing wire transfer orders

•  Incoming wire transfers

•  Money orders

•  Cashier’s checks sold

•  Foreign currency sold

•  Signature cards

•  Monthly statements

•  Cancelled checks written on the account

•  Standing orders

•  Draft checks

Key  transaction  records  that  should  be  tracked
are  records  of  wire  transfers.  Wire  transfers
move  funds  from  one  bank  to  another  within  or
between countries. A wire transfer is initiated by a
bank customer or other person, called the sender,
instructing the bank to send funds by wire to an
account or person at another bank. The ultimate
recipient  is  called  the  beneficiary.  Sometimes,  a
wire transfer goes through or is processed by an
intermediary bank.

Many  countries  require  financial  institutions
to  keep  records  of  transactions  above  certain
amounts. In the US, financial institutions, includ-
ing broker-dealers, must keep records of the par-
ties involved in wire or funds transfers in amounts
of more than $3,000. These records may be sub-
poenaed  in  criminal  and  civil  litigation.  Money
transmitters, which often deal in smaller amounts,
must also keep records of their transfers.

Once  the  records  are  obtained  or  gathered,
the  investigator  should  prepare  summaries  of
the  information  in  all  the  financial  documents
received  from  a  financial  institution,  including
the following:

•  A summary of deposits and withdrawals

•  A summary of checks written on the account

•  A summary of wire transfers into or out

of the account

•  Increases and decreases in account balances

Along  with  the  account  records,  an  investigator
should obtain all the account documents related
to  the  account  opening  and  customer  onboard-
ing, including the following:

•  Account application

•  Copy of signature card

•  Copy of customer IDs used to open account

•  Letter of referral or introduction

•  The bank’s due diligence records prepared for

the customer

RECEIPTS AND RELATED EXPENSE
DOCUMENTATION
Receipts  can  be  helpful  for  verifying  a  journal
entry,  a  reimbursed  expense,  or  a  department’s
expenses.  One  red  flag  to  be  aware  of  with
receipts is if copies are allowed or accepted. Cop-
ies  can  be  applied  to  more  than  one  account  or
conceal alterations to the original.

Another  red  flag  in  receipts  and  expenses  inves-
tigations is the absence of a division of duties in
review of expenses, or possibly the absence of a
review  system.  A  proper  review  system  should
include  verifying  the  expense,  checking  that  it
was  approved  before  the  expense  occurred,  and
collection  of  original  documentation  to  support
the expense.

JOURNAL ENTRIES
Journal entries can be completely falsified, espe-
cially  in  a  fraud,  to  inappropriately  recognize
assets  or  create  fictitious  assets.  They  may  also
be  a  good  source  of  information  on  inappropri-
ate  revenues  or  expenses.  Look  for  ambiguous
entries  for  “services”  or  “consulting”  that  either
the  entity  does  not  provide  or  need.  There  may

income  from  a  loan,  actually  belong  in  cash  but
was reported as revenue?

VENDOR/CUSTOMER LIST
If  the  entity  is  paying  vendors  or  customers,
investigators  need  complete  access  to  that  list.
Look for legitimacy when researching the vendor
list. Illegitimate vendors, which in some situations
may be shell companies, can be compared against
the employee list to see if there is an address or
name in common. This may necessitate a detailed
search, as the shell company could be registered
in a family member name of the employee.

Look for vendor charges that are steadily rising or
inappropriate to the industry. There may be col-
lusion between the vendor and an employee with
the authority to pay or approve the shipment.

In  many  cases,  businesses  and  organizations
will  maintain  a  “preferred  vendor  list.”  These
are  vendors  that  have  already  had  due  diligence
conducted on them by the business and are con-
sidered  approved  as  suppliers  or  service  provid-
ers. This preferred vendor list can also be a help-
ful  source  in  financial  crime  investigations.  The
financial crime professional should compare the
preferred  vendor  list  against  vendors  that  have
been used recently to determine if an employee
or company insider is using vendors that do not
appear on the preferred list. Vendors that appear
to have been added to the preferred list without
proper  due  diligence  or  authorization  can  also
be  a  potential  indicator  of  suspicious  or  fraudu-
lent activity.

INVENTORY
Obtaining  inventory  records  is  crucial  in  cases
involving loss or theft of physical inventory. When
reviewing inventory records, financial crime pro-
fessionals should look for dates of physical counts
as  well  as  a  policy  for  physical  counts,  such  as

THE WORLD CUSTOMS
ORGANIZATION (WCO)
The World Customs Organization (WCO) is
an  intergovernmental  organization  head-
quartered in Brussels, Belgium. The WCO
is noted for its work in areas covering the
development of international conventions,
instruments  and  tools  on  topics  such  as
commodity  classification,  valuation,  rules
of  origin,  collection  of  customs  revenue,
supply  chain  security,  international  trade
facilitation,  customs  enforcement  activ-
ities,  combating  counterfeiting  in  sup-
port  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  (IPR),
integrity  promotion  and  delivering  sus-
tainable  capacity  building  to  assist  with
customs reforms and modernization. The
WCO  maintains  the  international  Harmo-
nized  System  (HS)  goods  nomenclature
and  administers  the  technical  aspects
of  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)
Agreements  on  Customs  Valuation  and
Rules of Origin.

also  be  a  trend  toward  one  vendor,  employee
or department.

Another red flag with journal entries are descrip-
tions that include specifics on extensive payment
contingencies,  which  possibly  indicates  “chan-
nel stuffing.” This is the process of pushing more
products  through  a  given  distribution  than  the
channel can possibly sell. It is designed to inflate
sales figures.

Items in journal entries on a more detailed trans-
action can be subject to error, intentional or not.
This  can  be  a  source  of  information  to  verify
where incorrectly entered transactions should be
located. For example, did the transaction, such as

One should check the policy for disposal of obso-
lete  or  spoiled  inventory.  Look  for  patterns  of
either  writing  off  inventory  for  year-end  “earn-
ings management” or suspicious writing off that
is actually theft of the inventory by an employee.

COMMERCIAL INVOICES
A commercial invoice may be just a simple bill pre-
sented in a commercial transaction. More often, it
refers to a document used in international trade.
It  typically  will  contain  the  information  neces-
sary  for  presentation  of  shipping  declarations
to  a  customs  authority  of  a  particular  country.
Although  there  is  no  standard  format  for  a  com-
mercial invoice, the World Customs Organization
(WCO) sets standards for the information needed
on  the  form  in  an  effort  to  create  transparency
of  information  between  countries.  Some  of  the
information  contained  in  a  commercial  invoice
includes the following:

•  The parties involved in the

shipping transaction

•  The goods being transported

•  The country of manufacture, and codes

for those goods

A  commercial  invoice  must  also  include  a  state-
ment  certifying  that  the  invoice  is  true,  and  a
signature. Due to the amount of information typ-
ically  required  by  customs  authorities,  the  com-
mercial invoice can provide valuable information
to  the  financial  crime  specialist.  Caution  should
always  be  taken  to  notice  not  just  the  informa-
tion that is on the form, but also what information
appears to be missing.

Although  estimates  vary  widely,  the  consensus
is  that  international  trade  is  one  of  the  biggest
vehicles  used  by  transnational  criminal  and  ter-
rorist organizations for financing and laundering
the  proceeds  of  their  illicit  activities.  Therefore,
when investigating these types of criminal activ-
ity, the commercial invoice is a vital piece of evi-
dence  needed  for  analyzing  the  financial  activi-
ties of subjects of the investigation. Commercial

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

invoices  are  also  critical  evidence  in  customs
duties,  tax  evasion  and  alternative  remittance
systems investigations.

Following are some of the red flags for the finan-
cial  crime  specialist  in  analyzing  commercial
invoice data:

•  Discrepancies in the description of goods

shipped between the commercial invoice and
other documentation

•  Large price differences between the declared
value of the goods and the WCO standard
values for similar goods

•  Atypical financing for the goods

•  Illogical shipping routes and stops for the

goods on their way to their final destination

•  Inconsistent size of the declared amount and/
or size of the declared trade goods with the
shipping container or the weight

•  Counterfeit, false documentation

•  False sets of books

Some  of  the  money  laundering  methodologies
associated  with  commercial  invoices  and  trade-
based money laundering includes under and over
invoicing;  misrepresentation  of  quantity,  quality,
product, or cost; recycling products; and non-ex-
istent or false products.

Investigative  strategies  for  commercial  invoice
manipulation include the following:

•  Bank account analysis for unusual deposit

activity associated with the payment
for trade goods

•  Analysis of Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)

reporting of large currency transactions and
suspicious activity

•  Analysis of shippers’ import and export

declarations against inventory amount and
valuation data

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

•  Spot inspection of import or export trade

goods for quality and quantity comparisons
to the commercial invoice

Sources  of  information  available  to  the  finan-
cial  crime  specialist  in  investigations  involving
commercial invoicing include freight forwarders,
insurance  companies,  transport  companies,  cus-
toms services and shipping companies.

RECONCILIATIONS ON
INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS
Intercompany  transactions  can  be  material,
such  as  a  transfer  of  inventory  or  allocation  of
R&D  costs  between  units.  However,  if  the  com-
pany does not correctly reconcile these transac-
tions  with  a  policy  to  investigate  discrepancies,
it  could  result  in  an  overall  company  material
misstatement.

This may be in error or intentional, but will start
with  an  investigation  on  how  transfers  of  inven-
tory are initiated, received and reconciled.

There are many ways to overstate income or assets:

•  Bill and hold transactions. These overstate

revenue when a company invoices the
customer and records the sale as recognized
even though the asset remains in the seller’s
physical possession until a later date. A sign
of fraud would be the seller counting both
the “inventory not yet shipped” as “inventory
on hand,” as well as recognizing the revenue
from the sale.

•  Late recognition of returns. This could be

another form of “earnings management” or
a sign of theft and fraud. If returns are not
recognized at all (for example the inventory
count does not change to the return), this
could be a fraud at point of sale/point of
return. This can be incredibly hard to detect,
especially if there is collusion.

•  Mark-to-market accounting. This is an

accounting practice that refers to recording
assets or liabilities based on their current

market price, rather than their historical
costs. Although an entirely legitimate
practice if done correctly, it can also be used
to commit fraud, particularly in situations
where it is difficult to determine an accurate
market price for assets.

•  Inappropriate inventory write-off. This is the
moving, spoiling or destroying of inventory
to change year-end reporting or to hide
employee theft.

CANCELLED CHECKS
Cancelled  checks  have  always  provided  one  of
the most fruitful caches of leads for the financial
crime  investigator  because  one  document  may
provide the complete picture of a financial trans-
action, including date to amount, the recipient of
the funds, the payer of the funds, the method and
location of negotiation, and the final disposition of
the funds. This has changed to some extent in the
US with the advent of laws allowing digital copies
of checks, which eliminates the need to retain the
physical  copy.  Other  countries  now  have  similar
laws  in  place,  so  the  financial  crime  investiga-
tor should be well-versed in his or her country’s
rules regarding cancelled check retention.

Copies  of  cancelled  checks  are  still  maintained
by banks in accordance with regulatory require-
ments of the countries in which they are located.
Paper  copies  of  cancelled  checks  may  not  be
available to customers of the banks and, thus, not
available  for  subpoena  or  search  warrant.  How-
ever, the electronic age has brought new formats
and  record  retention,  which  when  understood
may  provide  better  and  quicker  access  to  the
financial  information  associated  with  the  tradi-
tional cancelled check. Since all of the data is now
captured  electronically,  it  can  be  searched  and
retrieved with greater accuracy and quickness.

The  following  outline  identifies  some  lines  of
inquiry  the  financial  crime  specialist  should  fol-
low when dealing with cancelled checks:

A. Business or personal check

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

181

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

•  May identify an unknown bank account

 » Who owns or opened the account?

 » What is the source of funds going into

the account?

 » What other account activity is connected
to the subject or identified associates or
co-conspirators?

•  May identify a nominee, front or shell

company, or associate the subject is using to
conceal illicit proceeds

•  May identify a business or individual who is

conspiratorially linked to the subject

B. Cashier’s or bank check

•  On what bank is the cashier’s check drawn?

•  Was it drawn against an account?

 » If not, how was it paid for?

 » What was the form of payment?

•  Who purchased the cashier’s check?

•  Was a large currency or suspicious activity
report filed by the bank in connection with
the purchase of the cashier’s check, if such a
report was required?

C. Money orders and travelers checks

•  Where were they purchased?

•  By whom were they purchased?

•  What was the form of payment?

It  is  a  good  practice  when  dealing  with  bank
checks and monetary instruments not drawn on
an  account  to  request  the  consecutively  num-
bered  bank  checks  and  monetary  instruments
immediately  preceding  and  following  the  identi-
fied monetary instrument, in case the subject or
co-conspirator purchased more than one.

ANALYSIS OF TAX RETURNS
Tax  returns  can  yield  important  information
about  a  multitude  of  a  subject’s  activities  and

assets,  including  real  estate  and  personal  prop-
erty, securities accounts, insurance policies, cars,
boats and many other things. Sources of income,
including  salary,  interest,  dividends,  rents,  pur-
chase  and  sale  of  assets,  may  also  be  identified.
The  tax  return  lists  banks  and  broker-  dealers
that  paid  dividends  or  interest.  Comparing  tax
return  items  from  one  year  to  the  next,  such  as
property taxes and interest expense, can tell a lot
about assets, incomes and sources of funding.

OBTAINING TAX RETURNS
The  value  of  tax  returns  is  offset  somewhat  by
the difficulty in obtaining them. In the majority of
jurisdictions, tax information is guarded by strict
secrecy  laws.  In  a  private  sector  financial  crime
case,  a  tax  return  can  be  very  hard  to  obtain
unless the target furnishes it.

In  the  public  sector,  one  must  follow  the  proce-
dures of the appropriate tax authority. Individual
and  business  tax  returns  should  be  obtained,  if
possible.  They  may  reveal  a  trove  of  otherwise
unavailable  information.  Sometimes,  tax  returns
aid in unearthing hidden assets or income, such
as hidden business ventures acquired with finan-
cial crime proceeds. Review interest or dividends
from hidden investments or capital gains on the
sale of hidden assets or income from the criminal
activity that may be listed as “consulting fees or
commissions.”

You should not ignore the tax lawyer, accountant
or  preparer  who  may  be  inclined  to  cooperate
because  of  their  potential  liability  under  the  tax
laws. Usually, they will not cooperate unless their
client  authorizes  them  to  do  so  or  unless  they
appear  under  compulsory  legal  process,  such  as
a grant of immunity.

Other  ways  to  obtain  tax  returns
the following:

include

•  Subpoena the tax preparer or certified public
accountant, keeping in mind that they risk

CHAPTER 9 • INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

When  dealing  with  electronic  information,  han-
dling  for  integrity  and  documenting  a  chain  of
custody  are  equally  important.  Just  as  original
documents  need  to  be  protected,  controls  need
to  be  established  to  prevent  the  overwriting  of
electronic  information.  Investigators  should  be
careful not to unintentionally alter metadata that
could be useful, such as the name of the user who
last  edited  a  file,  for  example,  or  the  date  a  file
was last accessed.

To  maximize  the
likelihood  that  electronic
records  can  be  entered  into  evidence,  investi-
gators  will  generally  need  a  clear  and  thorough
understanding  of  how  the  data  were  obtained
and  who  was  involved  in  gathering,  storing  and
transmitting  it.  For  some  investigations,  includ-
ing those involving multiple countries or jurisdic-
tions, this can be challenging.

Professionals  should  determine  if  they  need
parties  with  technical  skills  to  ensure  data  are
captured  correctly  at  the  outset  and  preserved
throughout  the  process  of  investigation.  If  the
source,  origin  and  chain  of  custody  of  data  are
not  clear,  the  ability  to  enter  that  data  into  evi-
dence may be compromised.

For example, let’s say an investigator involved in
an anti-corruption probe has requested payment
records  from  an  affiliate  of  a  multinational  cor-
poration. The affiliate is in another country. The
investigator receives the records on a hard drive,
but  there  is  no  accompanying  documentation
explaining how the data was originally obtained,
which  employees  were  involved  in  handling  it,
and the process they followed. This lack of clarity
will greatly reduce the chances that the payment
records could be used in a legal case.

liability to their client if they release the tax
return without permission or compulsion

•  Subpoena the taxpayer or target

•  Asking business partners for copies of the

corporate or partnership tax return, if they
also signed the return

•  Subpoena the mortgage company, bank

or closing agent, or mortgage broker, who
may have copies of the tax return provided
by the subject

•  Subpoena municipal and state tax authorities
for copies of tax returns filed by the subjects
in their jurisdiction

PROTECTING THE EVIDENCE
At  the  beginning  of  an  investigation,  one  does
not  have  a  clear  picture  of  which  financial  doc-
uments will be relevant and which will not. Thus,
all  financial  documents  should  be  handled  as  if
they  will  be  material  evidence  in  a  future  legal
proceeding or action. A proper chain of custody
must be followed.

Chain  of  custody  procedures  include  a  docu-
mented  chronology  of  the  handling  of  the  doc-
ument  or  physical  evidence.  Important  chain  of
custody documentation may include the following:

•  Where the item was initially located

•  Who collected it

•  Where it was filed

•  Documentation of each person

who handled it

Whenever  possible,  original  documents  should
be  obtained,  or  it  should  be  noted  why  the  orig-
inals  were  unavailable.  This  makes  it  extremely
important  to  protect  and  control  the  document.
Detailed  and  accurate  chain  of  custody  records
will help if evidence is ever altered or damaged –
either accidentally or intentionally.

MONEY
AND
COMMODITIES
FLOW

 OVERVIEW

Financial  crime  usually  has  several  goals.  It  seeks  to  earn  or

preserve money or other assets obtained through illegal means,

including  corruption,  tax  evasion,  money  laundering,  fraud,

sanctions violations, and those that have emerged from, or were

facilitated  by,  new  electronic  tools,  such  as  identity  theft  and

various types of cybercrimes.

184

In  the  execution,  cover-up,  laundering  and  ulti-
mate  use  and  enjoyment  of  financial  crime  pro-
ceeds, the money or commodity that is involved
typically  must  be  transferred  through  multiple
accounts,  vehicles  and  entities.  This  “flow”  of
money or commodities linked to financial crime
is executed and directed by the financial criminal
and  his  collaborators  and  co-  conspirators.  The
collaborators  and  co-conspirators  could  include
a  banker  or  corporate  official,  who  knowingly
or unknowingly is an accomplice in the criminal
operation. The word “commodities,” as used here,
refers  to  value  or  goods  obtained  through  ille-
gal activity.

Without the successful movement or flow of the
criminal  proceeds  and  their  ultimate  use,  the
financial criminal cannot succeed. His goal is to
take  from,  or  deprive,  someone  or  something,
such  as  an  institution  or  government  agency,  of
money or other assets. The vital step in the pro-
cess is to move the proceeds of his crime for his
own purpose and enjoyment.

This chapter will discuss some of the major meth-
ods that are employed in the movement of money
and  other  financial  assets.  This  will  include  red
flags  that  financial  crime  specialists  should  look
for in their work of examining money flows.

The  number  of  money  movement  mechanisms
is limited only by the creativity and ingenuity of
the financial criminal. Wire and electronic funds
transfer  facilities,  currency,  international  trade,
Hawala,  and  mobile  money  and  other  vehicles
spawned  by  new  technologies  are  just  a  few  of
the  avenues  available  to  move  money  and  value
at various phases of the financial crime process.

As  new  routes  are  opened  by  technology,  the
old  ones  do  not  go  away.  They  remain,  leav-
ing  financial  crime  specialists  with  a  constantly
growing list of routes through which money can
move. Thus, the new technological vehicles stand
alongside ancient ones, such as Hawala, a centu-
ries-old  method  of  money  movement  popular  in

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

parts of the world like the Middle East and Africa,
which moves billions of dollars in paperless form
often without leaving trails.

FREQUENTLY USED VEHICLES
TO MOVE MONEY
We first examine the tools that financial criminals
use  most  often.  Some  methods  to  move  money
and other assets include the following:

•  Checks

•  Wire transfers

•  Electronic transfers

•  Correspondent banking

•  Private banking

•  Informal systems for the movement of assets

•  International trade, including trade finance

•  Currency

•  Securities and financial products and
instruments, such as futures, bonds,
derivatives and insurance policies.

Two of the old but popular informal methods to
move  funds  include  Hawala  and  the  so-called
Black Market Peso Exchange, which are covered
later in this chapter.

Among  the  emerging  technologies  that  serve  to
move money and create new challenges for finan-
cial crime specialists are the following:

•  Virtual currencies and online

money exchanges

•  Pre-paid cards

•  Mobile payments

USE OF MULES AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES
Money  mules  are  persons  who  move  criminal
proceeds for the purpose of disguising the iden-
tity of the beneficiary or source. Sometimes they
are willing participants who know they are mov-
ing  criminal  proceeds,  and  other  times  they  are

185

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

unwitting  participants  who  have  been  recruited
through the Internet or e-mail scams. The typical
scheme  involves  placing  a  large  deposit  into  the
account of the “mule,” who then moves the money
to another account or person, retaining a fee for
his service.

CHECKS AND BANK STATEMENTS
Virtually  everyone  is  familiar  with  a  check,  the
paper  document  that  orders  the  payment  of
money from the account of the writer, known as
the drawer, at a bank or other financial institution
to  the  account  of  the  receiver.  The  use  of  paper
checks  and  other  documents  as  the  primary
means  of  making  payments  in  the  financial  sys-
tem has fallen significantly in recent years. Also,
most financial institutions no longer have an obli-
gation to return canceled checks, thus reducing,
or making more difficult, the amount of informa-
tion that can be gathered unless the information
is subpoenaed in an electronic format. In addition
to  examining  the  paper  or  electronic  version  of
a  check,  the  examination  of  a  bank  statement,
which  may  or  may  not  include  digital  copies  of
checks, can be very useful in mapping the flow of
money or other assets.

When a financial crime specialist  has the oppor-
tunity to review checks and bank statements, it is
wise to be guided by these procedures:

•  Make note of payees on a check, especially
corporations, trusts, foreign entities and
other organizations.

•  Compare the payees to the endorsers or the
ultimate deposit accounts to determine their
consistency, among other things.

•  Pay attention to checks drawn to cash, which

will often provide information about the
recipient and his or her related organizations.

•  In reviewing a bank statement, make note of
the volume of checks and the pattern of use
of the account.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

•  Note any large checks or transfers that do

not fit the normal pattern of the general use
of the account.

•  Canceled checks often have notes and
numbers written on the back by bank
employees, indicating such things as the
purchase of a cashier’s check or use of the
funds for a wire transfer. The financial crime
specialist should make notes of all these
markings, including the names of the bank
employees, and start an inventory of all
accounts to which transfers are made, the
names of any reference to individuals and
other information.

CORRESPONDENT
BANK ACCOUNTS
A  basic  domestic  bank  typically  only  offers
local services to customers, including depos-
its  and  loans.  If  those  customers  travel  out-
side  of  the  bank’s  operating  region,  accept
international  deposits  or  engage  in  other
activities  outside  the  bank’s  coverage  area,
the bank either needs to open a new branch
or make arrangements with a correspondent
bank. Opening new branches may not always
be  feasible  or  desirable,  so  a  correspondent
bank account provides a convenient solution.

A  correspondent  bank  is  a  financial  institu-
tion  that  acts  as  an  agent  for  another  bank,
providing  services  and  products  in  an  area
the  other  bank  does  not  operate  in,  so  its
customers can access things like wire trans-
fers  and  international  deposits.  This  allows
banks  of  all  sizes  to  do  business  in  other
regions  and  countries  without  having  to
open  new  branches,  keeping  these  services
at an affordable price for customers. Banks of
all sizes can act as correspondent banks, and
numerous international financial institutions
have a correspondent banking branch to pro-
vide services to smaller banks with less reach.

WIRE TRANSFERS
Wire transfers have long been identified as a tool
at all steps in the financial crime process: To move
money from the victim to the financial criminal;
from  the  financial  criminal  through  the  various
layers that he may use to hide, disguise and move
the proceeds; and to the ultimate application the
financial criminal makes of the proceeds.

Wire transfers are an all-purpose vehicle to move
money  and  assets  in  most  financial  crime  sce-
narios.  They  can  be  used  in  the  placement,  lay-
ering  or  integration  stages  of  money  laundering
of  the  financial  crime  proceeds.  All  three  clas-
sic  money  laundering  stages  should  be  kept  in
mind  when  the  financial  crime  specialist  is  eval-
uating or assessing the money flow aspects of a
financial crime.

Financial institutions, which serve as the conduit
by which wire transfers are executed, must have
well-considered policies and processes that man-
age  these  risks  of  the  susceptibility  of  wire  and
other funds transfers for serving illegal purposes.

These policies and procedures should encompass
more  than  regulatory  recordkeeping  minimums,
including monitoring whether wire transfers vio-
late  sanctions  laws  or  further  financial  criminal
activity in all stages in the process. The policies
and  processes  should  cover  foreign  correspon-
dent bank accounts and transactions in which the
affiliates and agencies of foreign banks and other
financial  institutions  serve  as  intermediaries  for
their headquarters office.

Correspondent  banking  is  covered  in  other  sec-
tions of this manual and is an important element
in the overall financial crime picture. For the pur-
poses of this chapter, it is worth mentioning that
the  due  diligence  procedures  applied  to  corre-
spondent accounts should take into account the
correspondent institution’s practices concerning
monitoring and processing of wire transfers.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

In  the  international  interbank  context,  a  cover
payment  is  an  agreement  to  cover  the  funds
related to an underlying monetary movement. In
other  words,  there  are  two  payments.  One  is  a
payment order, which instructs the bank for the
beneficiary  of  the  payment  to  pay  the  receiver
a  specified  sum.  The  second  message  is  the
bank-to-bank  instruction  that  tells  the  interme-
diary  bank  to  cover  the  payment  of  the  benefi-
ciary’s bank.

Financial  institutions  can  mitigate  the  risk  asso-
ciated  with  cover  payments  by  managing  cor-
respondent  banking  relationships  carefully.  The
Wolfsberg  Group’s  best  practices,  which  are  dis-
cussed below, and the SWIFT standards for send-
ing  wires,  which  recommend  appropriate  trans-
action screening and monitoring, are two sound
starting  points  for  a  correspondent  and  wire
compliance program.

INTERMEDIARY BANKS
An Intermediary Bank is any bank through
which  a  payment  must  go  to  reach  the
beneficiary bank. Intermediary Banks help
process  a  transfer  of  funds  and  perform
any necessary currency exchange.

An  Intermediary  Bank  is  a  bank  that  has
your  beneficiary  bank’s  account.  This  is
usually  the  case  if  the  beneficiary’s  bank
doesn’t have an office in a particular loca-
tion.  For  example,  if  you  were  execut-
ing  a  payment  order  via  SWIFT  200  and
you  wanted  to  pay  a  vendor  in  the  Baha-
mas, the payment order would leave your
bank and go to the beneficiary’s bank, but
before  the  money  is  credited  to  the  ben-
eficiary,  it  passes  through  the  beneficia-
ry’s  bank’s  account  at  the  Intermediary
Bank.  Basically,  it’s  the  bank  of  the  bene-
ficiary’s bank.

The  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision
issued  a  May  2009  paper  on  cross-border  cover
payments  called  the  BIS  Cover  Payments  Paper.
It encouraged financial institutions that conduct
international payments transactions to adhere to
the  message  standards  developed  by  the  Wolfs-
berg Group in 2007, and others.

RED FLAGS OF WIRE TRANSFERS
Laws  and  regulations  have  been  enacted  in
many  countries  attempting  to  make  it  difficult
to exploit wire transfers to move criminal money.
The  following  types  of  funds  transfer  activities
should  be  scrutinized  closely  because  they  can
serve  to  move  illicit  funds.  This  is  not  meant  to
be  an  exhaustive  list,  and  their  mere  existence
in  a  scenario  does  not  equate  to  criminal  activ-
ity.  However,  mapping  the  flows  and  objectively
determining a valid reason for these transactions
is a very important step in financial crime inves-
tigation, prevention or detection.

Because of their thoroughness and completeness,
this  listing  borrows  from  some  of  the  elements
contained in the guidance published by the United
States Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council (US FFIEC), an umbrella organization that
serves as a forum for the collaboration of various
US financial institutions and regulatory agencies.

Funds transfers to tax and secrecy havens. There
are more than 60 such havens around the world.
What  jurisdictions  can  be  considered  secrecy
havens is a much-debated issue. Some commonly
cited examples include Switzerland, Lichtenstein,
Panama,  the  Cayman  Islands,  the  Cook  Islands,
the US states of Delaware and Nevada, and others.

Funds  transfers  that  are  subject  to  instructions
to  “pay  upon  proper  identification.”  The  “PUPI
instructions”  are  made  to  the  receiving  bank.
Financial  crime  investigators  should  be  alert  to
the  amount  that  is  transferred  for  signs  that  it
may be just under the amount that triggers a cur-
rency transaction report to the authorities in the

Outgoing  funds  transfers  requested  by  a
non-customer  or  account  holder.  If  the  policies
of a bank or other financial institution permit the
purchase  of  a  wire  transfer  by  a  non-customer,
especially one for a significant amount, the insti-
tution  should  be  extremely  careful  about  the
identities of the parties and the destination of the
money, especially to an offshore location.

Wire transfers that do not make sense or appear
to  have  no  legitimate  business  reason.  A  cus-
tomer  who  engages  in  frequent  wire  transfer
activity that is not justified by his or her normal
circumstances  should  receive  extreme  scrutiny
by  the  financial  institution,  and,  in  appropriate
circumstances,  become  the  subject  of  a  suspi-
cious activity report.

A  customer  with  low  account  balances  who
sends or receives frequent wire transfers. This
type of activity should prompt suspicions among
the  employees  of  the  affected  financial  institu-
tion because it is not logical for a customer with
low account balances to be serving as a conduit
for incoming and outgoing funds transfers.

A  quick  succession  of  incoming  and  outgoing
wire  transfers  in  similar  or  exact  monetary
amounts. Often, this pattern of wire transfers of
like amounts in and out of an account or related
accounts  close  in  time  should  raise  deep  suspi-
cions. A customer may also receive several small
incoming wires, and then send a large transfer to
another city or country.

Customers with cash-intensive businesses that
send large funds transfers. This situation could
reflect  several  illegal  financial  activities,  includ-
ing  tax  evasion,  laundering  of  the  proceeds  of
other crimes, and the payment or transmittal of
funds destined for corrupt payments. In general,
businesses that are cash-intensive should receive
scrutiny,  and  when  they  involve  frequent  wire
transfers, special scrutiny is recommended.

MOVEMENT OF MONEY IN TRADE AND
COMMODITIES TRANSACTIONS
Financial  criminals  are  nimble  and  adapt  their
activities  and  procedures  to  skirt  statutory  and
regulatory requirements. As laws and regulations
change to thwart the ability of financial criminals
to move or use their criminal proceeds, financial
criminals adopt new methods to make safe use of
their  money  and  escape  detection.  One  method
that  first  came  to  widespread  attention  in  the
late  1980s  used  international  trade  through  the
manipulation of prices of imports and exports.

This  method,  which  is  now  known  by  the  popu-
lar name Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML),
was recognized by the Financial Action Task force
in 2006 as one of the three principal avenues for
moving  money  to  disguise  or  integrate  criminal
proceeds into the legitimate economy or to move
money needed to finance other crimes, including
terrorism. The FATF defines TBML as ‘the process
of  disguising  the  proceeds  of  crime  and  moving
value through the use of trade transactions in an
attempt to legitimize their illicit origin.’ In 2008,
the definition was revised in the FATF Best Prac-
tices Paper to expand the definition:

“…the  process  of  disguising  the  proceeds  of
crime  and  moving  value  through  the  use  of
trade transactions in an attempt to legitimize
their illicit origins or finance their activities.”
(Emphasis added).

TBML  may  be  accomplished  by  using  combina-
tions of over-valued or under-valued imports and
exports to achieve a transfer of money from one
country to another.

A  customer  who  uses  cash  or  bearer  instru-
ments  to  purchase  funds  transfers.  The  use  of
cash, in general, is cause for concern, but when it
is used to purchase wire or other funds transfers,
it borders on outright suspicious, especially if it is
a frequent occurrence.

Unusual  funds  transfer  transactions  by  corre-
spondent  banks  or  other  financial  institutions.
Transactions  with  one’s  own  institution  by  for-
eign  correspondent  banks  always  deserve  scru-
tiny  because  of  the  history  that  correspondent
accounts  have  of  being  involved  in  a  multitude
of financial crimes and money laundering. Suspi-
cious activity by these institutions may include a
volume of wire transfers that is inordinately large
in  relation  to  the  size  of  the  bank,  the  large  vol-
ume of funds transfer activities that are inconsis-
tent with the size and policies of the institution,
and  a  high  volume  of  funds  transfers  of  similar
amounts on one or consecutive days.

Out-of-country  funds  transfers  that  are  incon-
sistent with the customer’s profile or business. A
domestic customer who engages in international
funds transfers in amounts or frequency that are
inconsistent  with  the  nature  of  the  customer’s
legitimate business may indicate involvement in a
financial crime, including money laundering.

A simple example would be:

Country  X  to  Person  B  in  Country  Y.  Person  B
buys 10,000 widgets in Country Y and exports
them to Person A in Country X with an invoice
for $100 per widget, although he only paid $10
per  widget.  Person  A  or  B  goes  to  a  bank  to
obtain  trade  financing  to  finance  the  exporta-
tion  or  importation  of  10,000  widgets  at  $100
apiece. The financing is achieved, and Person A
pays Person B the $1 million that is invoiced. By

By  using  international  trade  and  the  manipula-
tion  of  the  prices  that  pertain  to  the  products
being shipped, persons may move money in either
direction  disguised  as  the  cost  of  the  products
being  imported  or  exported.  This  works  both
ways, as follows:

•  To move money into one country from

another, the parties may understate the price
of imported goods or overstate the price of
exported goods.

Largest, it Handled Approximately 32 Million Shipping
Containers in 2012, Demonstrating the Sheer Volume

the parties may overstate the price of
imported goods or understate the price of
exported goods.

These international trade operations require the
two parties working in league with each other. By
doing so, they can achieve their goals in moving
different amounts of money at any time. To facil-
itate  the  commission  of  crimes,  such  as  terror-
ism, trade-based money laundering may be used
to  send  money  to  terrorists  in  the  jurisdiction
where they are operating.

More than 35 million containers of goods arrive in
or leave the US every year, and major industrial-
ized nations, as well as rapidly developing nations
such as China and Brazil, have even higher totals.
The sheer magnitude of this commerce makes it
very  difficult  to  detect  the  movement  of  money
linked  to  financial  crime  in  wider  international
trade.  It  is  like  finding  a  lone  needle  in  a  hay-
stack of needles.

Sophisticated  data  mining  may  serve  to  detect
and  identify  some  international  trade  trans-
actions  that  are  linked  to  financial  crime  and
money laundering.

According  to  the  US  Department  of  Homeland
Security, which started the first Trade Transpar-
ency Unit (TTU) with the goal of identifying cus-
toms  fraud,  tax  evasion,  smuggling,  trade-based
money laundering and terrorist financing, the fol-
lowing indicators are red flags of the movement
of illicit funds in international trade transactions:

•  Payments to vendors in cash by unrelated

third parties

•  Payments to vendors by wire transfers from

unrelated third parties

•  Payments to vendors by checks, bank drafts

or postal money orders from unrelated

NON-BANK FOREIGN EXCHANGE
COMPANIES AND MONEY
TRANSMITTERS
Currency  exchange  providers  and  money  trans-
mitters,  which  are  often  referred  to  as  money
services businesses or MSBs, may be used in sev-
eral ways in the perpetration of financial crimes
and the laundering of criminal proceeds. In that
respect,  they  are  no  different  than  commercial
banks which may also be used in multiple ways in
the commission of financial crimes.

MSBs are used by millions of people for legitimate
reasons, including the transmittal of small sums to
family members of the sender in other countries.

VULNERABILITY OF MSBS TO MOVING
MONEY LINKED TO FINANCIAL CRIME
As stated above, MSBs are no different than banks
in  their  vulnerability  to,  and  use  by,  financial
criminals. The following are the principal reasons
for this vulnerability of MSBs:

•  Simplicity and certainty of the transactions

•  Global reach of the network of MSBs

•  Cash nature of the initial steps of the

transactions

INFORMAL VALUE TRANSFER SYSTEMS
AND THE MOVEMENT OF MONEY
An informal value transfer system (IVTS) is a sys-
tem for transferring value through the exchange
of  goods  or  currency  from  one  person  in  one
country  to  another  person  in  another  coun-
try.  IVTS  businesses  are  not  banks  in  the  tradi-
tional  sense.  They  maintain  their  own  financial
accounts but do not utilize the banking system to
transfer money or other value for their customers.

INFORMAL VALUE TRANSFER
SYSTEM LEGALITY
As  a  type  of  Money  Services  Business
(MSB) and specifically, as a type of money
transmitter,  IVTS  may  legally  operate  in
the  United  States,  so  long  as  they  abide
by  applicable  state  and  federal  laws.  This
includes  registering  with  FinCEN  and
complying  with  anti-money  laundering
and counter-terrorist financing provisions
of  the  Bank  Secrecy  Act  (BSA)  applicable
to  all  money  transmitters  and  to  certain
other MSBs. A more sophisticated form of
IVTS operating in the United States often
interacts  with  other  financial
institu-
tions in storing currency, clearing checks,
remitting and receiving funds, and obtain-
ing other routine financial services, rather
than  acting  independently  of  the  formal
financial system.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

IVTS  businesses  pre-date  traditional  banks.  Ini-
tially,  they  offered  barter  systems  to  resolve
accounts  and  to  foster  trade.  But  the  systems
have survived and today are used to send money
worldwide. Common types of IVTS include Hawala
networks and the Black Market Peso Exchange.

BLACK MARKET PESO EXCHANGE
The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) method
is an elaborate means of moving money and laun-
dering criminal proceeds. In broad terms, BMPE

is a system by which illicit proceeds are laundered
through a combination of exchange of currencies
and international trade in goods.

A  BMPE,  despite  the  name,  does  not  have  to
involve pesos, although the scheme originated in
Colombia and is still prevalent there. Traditionally,
laundering  through  BMPE  begins  with  the  pro-
ceeds of narcotics sold in the US. These funds are
in US dollars. Narcotics traffickers then contract
with  money  exchangers,  referred  to  as  “cambis-
tas”  or  peso  brokers,  to  purchase  the  dollars  at

a  reduced  rate.  The  cambista  holds  accounts  in
financial institutions in both the US and Colombia.

The cambista then swaps the US dollars for pesos
with  import/export  businesses  in  Colombia  and
other Latin American countries. These businesses
need  US  dollars  to  purchase  and  import  goods
from the US, which range from tobacco products
to home appliances. Many businesses involved in
the BMPE are completely legitimate, while others
illegally smuggle goods from the US to avoid cus-
toms  duties.  In  either  case,  businesses  typically
receive  US  dollars  at  a  significantly  lower  rate
than the official exchange rate.

Cambistas then pay off narcotics rings in Colom-
bia  with  the  pesos  they  receive  from  these  busi-
nesses, completing the BMPE cycle. As cambistas
receive  substantial  commissions  and  fees  from
the exchanges, and businesses receive a favorable
exchange rate, the BMPE can be quite profitable
for all parties involved. That is one of the reasons
the scheme has been so successful in past years.
Greater  awareness  of  BMPE  has  led  many  US
financial  institutions  to  restrict  or  cut  off  busi-
ness  with  suspect  Colombian  and  other  South
American  peso  brokers,  lessening  the  impact  of
BMPE in recent years. Nevertheless, the financial
crime specialist should remain aware of it, espe-
cially if they are pursuing a case or assignment in
a jurisdiction where use of BMPE is common.

HAWALA
Hawala is a type of IVTS that began in India but
is now used around the world, particularly in Asia
and the Middle East. It has been referred to as an
underground banking system. This is not entirely
correct  because  many  hawaladars,  as  they  are
called, conduct business in the open, legitimately,
with advertising and competition.

Hawala is based on trust and there is little paper
trail, such as checks or other instruments. Hawala
relies on strong personal and family connections
and other affiliations.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

A basic example of a Hawala transaction would be
a customer from country X seeking to send money
or satisfy an obligation to another from country Y.
A  hawaladar  from  country  X  would  then  receive
funds from country X and provide the customer
from  country  X  with  an  authentication  code.  A
corresponding hawaladar from country Y would
be instructed to deliver funds in the currency of
country Y to a specified beneficiary, who needs to
disclose the authentication code to receive funds.

Another  example  of  how  Hawala  works  is  found
in a report titled, The Hawala Alternative Remit-
tance  System  and  Its  Role  in  Money  Laundering,
by  the  Financial  Crimes  Enforcement  Network,
FinCEN,  a  bureau  of  the  US  Department  of  the
Treasury and Interpol.

Note the trust that is inherent in the example that
follows.  Tariq  gave  his  money  to  Yasmeen  and
received no receipt. He trusts that the Rs 180,000
will  reach  his  brother,  Waleed.  Yasmeen  keeps
track of how much money she owes Ghulam and
Ghulam,  of  course,  will  keep  track  of  what  Yas-
meen  owes  him.  The  relationship  between  Yas-
meen and Ghulam could be one of several types:

1.  They could be business partners or

individuals who do business together on a
regular basis. It could be in addition to other
business they engage in, such as CD or video
import or a tour agency

2.  Ghulam could owe Yasmeen a debt, and this

is a way to repay the debt,

3.  Yasmeen may have a surplus of rupees, and

this is a way to liquidate the surplus.

In  the  above  example,  neither  number  2  or  3
require Ghulam to recover any money. But in the
first  example,  further  interaction  is  needed  to
balance the books.

The lack of formal structure in Hawala leads to a
less bureaucratic approach than formal financial
institutions  and,  to  those  who  use  it,  is  thought
to be more reliable and convenient. As there is no

AN EXAMPLE OF A HAWALA TRANSACTION

Tariq is a Pakistani living in New York and driv-
ing a taxi. He entered the US on a tourist visa,
which has long since expired. From his job as
a taxi driver, he has savings of $5,000 that he
wants to send to his brother, Waleed, who lives
in Karachi. Even though Tariq is familiar with
the  Hawala  system,  his  first  stop  is  a  major
bank, where he learns several things:

•  The bank would prefer that he open an

account before doing business with them.

•  The bank will sell him Pakistani rupees
(Rs) at the official rate of 31 to the dollar.

This  arrangement  will  allow  Tariq  to  send
Waleed  Rs166,250,  instead  of  154,225.  As  we
will see, the delivery associated with a Hawala
transaction  is  faster  and  more  reliable  than
in  bank  transactions.  He  is  about  to  make
arrangements to do business with Iqbal when
he sees the following ad:

MUSIC BAZAAR AND TRAVEL SERVICES
Latest Bollywood Hits Video Conversations
Cheap Tickets to India and Pakistan
Great Rupee deals (service to India and Paki-
stan) Call Yasmeen at 718-555-1111

•  The bank will charge $25 to issue

a bank draft.

Tariq  calls  the  number  and  speaks  with  Yas-
meen. She offers him the following deal:

This will allow Tariq to send Waleed Rs154,225.
Delivery  would  be  extra—an  overnight  courier
service because surface mail is not always reli-
able,  especially  if  it  contains  something  valu-
able, and can cost as much as $40 to Pakistan—
and take up to a week to arrive. Tariq believes
he can get a better deal through Hawala, and
talks to Iqbal, a fellow taxi driver who is also a
part-time hawaladar.

•  A fee of 1 rupee for each dollar transferred

•  37 rupees for a dollar

•  Delivery is included

Under  these  terms,  Tariq  can  send  Waleed
Rs180,000.  He  decides
to  do  business
with Yasmeen.

The Hawala transaction proceeds as follows:

Iqbal offers Tariq the following terms:

•  Tariq gives the $5,000 to Yasmeen.

•  A 5% “commission” for handling

the transaction

•  35 instead of 31 rupees for a dollar

•  Delivery is included

•  Yasmeen contacts Ghulam in Karachi and

gives him the details.

•  Ghulam arranges to have Rs180,000

delivered to Waleed.

institutions, cultural factors such as kinship and
ethnicity play a vital role in the facilitation of the
transactions.

REASONS FOR USING HAWALA
Hawala  may seem  like  a  lot  of  trouble  in  today’s
world, when money can be moved rapidly through
the  traditional  banking  system  or  through  elec-
tronic  means.  However,  Hawala  offers  many
advantages,  according  to  these  points  gleaned
from  the  above-mentioned  study  by  FinCEN
and Interpol:

•  Cost effectiveness

•  Efficiency

•  Reliability

•  Lack of bureaucracy

•  No paper trail

•  Allows evasion of taxes

COMMODITIES TRADING
TO MOVE MONEY
One  emerging  method  of  moving  funds  is  com-
modities  purchases  and  trades.  In  these  situa-
tions, a financial criminal will purchase a type of
commodity  and  export  it  to  a  “beneficiary.”  Pur-
chase orders, invoices and other records lend an
air of legitimacy to the transaction.

Once  the  commodity  is  received  in  the  destina-
tion country, it is sold locally, which accomplishes
the task of exchanging one currency for another.
Sometimes, a third country is utilized to further
obscure the transaction.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

USING SECURITIES, FUTURES AND
DERIVATIVES TO MOVE MONEY
Trade in securities represents a multi-trillion dol-
lar sector of the global economy, with millions of
stocks,  bonds,  derivatives,  futures,  credit  swaps
and  other  financial  instruments  being  sold  and
purchased  on  dozens  of  exchanges  worldwide.
The actors involved in securities trading include
most of the world’s largest banks, major interna-
tional investment firms and government entities
such as sovereign wealth funds. They also include
an  array  of  smaller  brokerage  firms,  sole  propri-
etorship  broker-dealers  and  individual  traders.
Together  with  banking,  the  securities  industry
is  one  of  the  key  ways  that  persons  worldwide
access the global financial system.

Monitoring securities trading presents a distinct
challenge,  as  it  can  not  only  be  used  to  launder

COMMON INDICATORS OF
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
Some  of  the  most  common  indicators
of  suspicious  activity  in  the  securities
industry are:

•  Changing share ownership when
making a transfer across borders

•  Liquidating what would usually be
a long-term investment within a
short period

•  Using a brokerage account similar to a

depository account

•  Opening multiple accounts or

nominee accounts

•  Engaging in transactions involving

nominees or third parties

and  move  the  proceeds  of  criminal  activity,  but
also  be  manipulated  to  earn  illicit  proceeds.  As
insider  trading  and  other  forms  of  securities
fraud  are  addressed  in  the  Understanding  and
Preventing Fraud chapter, this chapter focuses on
using securities as a mechanism for transferring
dirty money. The financial crime specialist should
note that securities fraud and laundering through
securities are often closely interconnected.

The  laws  governing  securities  trading  vary  con-
siderably  from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction,  as  do
the  regulatory  and  enforcement  frameworks
around  securities  markets.  Many  of  the  larger
global exchanges, such as the London or New York
Stock  Exchanges,  are  closely  watched  by  a  num-
ber  of  market  regulators  and  oversight  bodies.
Other  exchanges  receive  considerably  less  scru-
tiny.  In  a  2010  typology  report,  the  FATF  found
that,  generally,  suspicious  activity  reporting  by
the  securities  industry  worldwide  remained  low,
potentially due to a lack of awareness of AML and
terrorist financing issues in the securities field.

The  term  “securities”  refers  to  different  types
of  financial  instruments  issued  by  companies
and  government  entities.  A  complete  explana-
tion of the instruments that qualify as securities
is beyond the scope of this manual, especially as
types of securities continuously grow and evolve.
Further reading is advised for the financial crime
specialist involved in cases involving securities.

BEARER SECURITIES
Although most securities are not now maintained
in  paper  form,  “bearer”  securities,  including
bearer  bonds,  still  exist  in  certain  jurisdictions.
These instruments are owned by the person who
“bears,” or possesses them. Once a bearer instru-
ment has been issued, the holder can transfer it
to  another  recipient  without  the  need  to  record
the  transaction.  Bearer  securities  can  be  depos-
ited  into  a  brokerage  account  and  then  be  used
to make other trades or to withdraw or wire the
entire funds.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

A similar type of security is a “bill of exchange” in
a  jurisdiction  where  it  is  redeemable  upon  pre-
sentation.  Similar  to  the  bearer  bond,  a  bill  of
exchange may be viewed as having a high level of
risk of being used in a financial crime scenario or
to launder criminal proceeds.

SECURITIES TRADING AS LAYERING
Purchasing most securities on exchanges or mar-
kets  almost  always  requires  an  account  of  some
kind  held  with  a  securities  broker,  which  is  typ-
ically  funded  by  another  account  at  a  financial
institution.  As  a  result,  securities  trading  is  not
often  the  first  stage  in  laundering  dirty  money.
However,  because  securities  trades  can  be  exe-
cuted  in  high  values  and  large  volumes,  they  do
represent  a  potential  avenue  for  layering  illicit
proceeds, by quickly creating a chain of transac-
tions to obscure the source of the funds.

One example of this is wash trading of stocks, or
simultaneously buying and selling shares of stock
in the same company through two different bro-
kers.  Although  this  is  usually  done  as  a  form  of
market  manipulation  in  order  to  make  it  appear
as if there is a high level of trading activity around
a certain stock, it can also be done simply to pile
up transactions and layer funds.

Another  sign  that  securities  trading  may  be  lay-
ering is if a broker is directed to make many rapid
purchases  of  a  security  with  no  discernible  pat-
tern,  purpose  or  underlying  market  rationale,
and then sell these securities after holding them
only briefly.

DERIVATIVES
Derivatives come in three forms: futures, options
and  swaps.  Using  derivatives  to  move  money
derived  from  financial  crime  requires  at  least  a
cursory understanding of how derivatives work.

Derivatives  are  essentially  a  bet  on  which  direc-
tion  the  price  will  move  for  some  underlying
value, which can be a commodity, a share of stock,
a  financial  asset,  foreign  exchange  or  an  index

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

WASH TRADING
The  most  common  technique  used  in  deriva-
tives trading to obscure illicit funds is known as
wash  trading.  The  financial  criminal  establishes
two  accounts.  One  account,  the  “dirty  money”
account,  is  held  by  a  seemingly  unrelated  party.
The  second  account  is  held  by  the  party  that
should  “receive”  the  payment,  such  as  a  politi-
cian who may be receiving a bribe. This scheme,
of  course,  requires  the  assistance  of  a  com-
plicit broker.

The financial criminal and the broker agree to set
up two positions that offset each other. When the
positions  come  due,  the  loss  is  assigned  to  the
dirty  money  account  and  the  gain  to  the  clean
money account. The difference in the two is the
cost of laundering the money.

OTHER DERIVATIVE TRADING RISKS
Derivatives  can  be  used  in  a  multitude  of  other
combinations to create the illusion of legitimacy
while,  at  the  same  time,  moving  money  across
borders  to  further  a  financial  crime,  launder
criminal  proceeds  or  finance  terrorism.  Taking
offsetting  positions  that  result  in  double  com-
missions  for  the  complicit  broker,  options  trad-
ing  with  offshore  companies,  client-  originated
insider  trading,  swaps  in  the  commodities  mar-
ket and auto-trading are some of the schemes or
factors  that  have  been  noted  in  recent  years  as
vehicles for moving money.

The  real  complexity  of  a  derivative  lies  in  the
underlying contract, which is also often complex.
The FATF has said in a report: “The way in which
derivatives  are  traded  and  the  number  of  opera-
tors in the market ensure that there is the poten-
tial  to  obscuring  the  connection  between  each
new participant and the original trade.”

Futures:  A  financial  contract  obligating
the  buyer  to  purchase  an  asset  (or  the
seller to sell an asset), such as a physical
commodity or a financial instrument, at
a predetermined future date and price.

Options: Financial derivative that repre-
sents a contract sold by one party (option
writer)  to  another  party  (option  holder).
The  contract  offers  the  buyer  the  right,

of these. The party betting that the price will go
down  is  said  to  be  “short”  on  the  contract.  The
party  betting  that  the  price  of  the  underlying
value will go up is said to be “long” on the contract.
If the price of the underlying value moves, there
will  be  a  winner  and  a  loser  in  connection  with
the  contract.  If  the  price  goes  up,  the  long  side
wins. If the price goes down, the short side wins.

The key to money laundering with derivatives is
to  manipulate  the  two  sides  of  the  contract  in
such a way that the losing side is associated with
the  dirty  money,  and  to  ensure  that  both  sides
are participants in the money laundering scheme.
Thus, the winning side gets clean money from suc-
cessful contracts, a legitimate source of income.

ONLINE SECURITIES TRADING ACCOUNTS
A  relatively  recent  development  is  the  rise  of
trading  accounts.
Internet-based
These  are  typically  offered  by  financial  institu-
tions  and  investment  firms,  and  allow  individual
investors  to  access  their  portfolio  of  securities.
In  some  jurisdictions,  they  allow  individual  cus-
tomers to transfer securities to another customer
account,  the  account  of  a  family  member  or  a
company account they control. Such easily acces-
sible means to transfer securities can be used in
tax fraud schemes, as a tax evader can shift their
control  of  the  securities  to  another  person  or
multiple persons and, therefore, avoid certain tax
liabilities on the dividends of their investments.

Such  a  transfer  scheme  could  also  be  used  for
money  laundering.  A  financial  criminal  could
conceivably  have  an  associate  or  family  member
open  an  online  securities  account  and  invest  in
a  portfolio  of  securities.  The  financial  criminal
would then pay them the cash value of their secu-
rities portfolio with illicit proceeds, allowing the
criminal to instantly gain access to “clean” funds.

The growth of online securities trading accounts
has also made it easier for financial criminals to
access  securities  markets  generally.  High  vol-
umes of transactions through online trading ser-
vices and a lack of direct contact with customers
can make it difficult for the financial institutions
that  host  such  accounts  to  know  their  custom-
ers  and  detect  suspicious  transactions.  Like  any
online  account,  online  securities  accounts  are
also  vulnerable  to  identity  thieves  and  account
takeover schemes.

Identity  thieves  can  open  online  accounts  in
order to move illicit proceeds or engage in secu-
rities frauds such as insider trading. Hackers can
take  control  of  an  online  securities  account  as
part  of  securities  manipulation  schemes,  using
the account to buy up a certain stock in order to
pump up its price, for example.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS
While  most  securities  are  traded  on  open
exchanges where any registered securities broker
can buy or sell them, some securities are traded
on  over-the-counter,  or  OTC,  markets.  “OTC
securities” generally refers to all securities traded
outside  of  the  traditional  exchanges,  which  usu-
ally  have  greater  regulation,  more  participants
and stricter requirements for the securities they
will  allow  to  be  listed.  In  some  cases,  OTC  mar-
kets are regulated and organized, and OTC trad-
ers must become market members.

In other cases, OTC markets receive significantly
less  oversight  and  can  simply  involve  groups
of  securities  brokers  trading  securities  among
themselves,  on  terms  they  negotiate  and  not  at
market rates.

In these instances, it is possible for OTC trades to
be  manipulated  to  pay  more  for  a  security  than
would  be  paid  at  a  reasonable  market  rate,  and
thus covertly transfer money to another party in
the  process.  One  example  is  through  the  trade
in  OTC  options,  a  form  of  security  that  allows
a  seller  to  drastically  inflate  the  price  they  are
offering for the option, or charge substantial pre-
miums to a buyer on their sale of options. In either
case,  funds  could  be  transferred  from  the  buyer
to the seller if the buyer purchased options at the
inflated price, or agreed to the high premium. As
OTC options trades can occur between parties in
different  jurisdictions,  this  is  one  potential  ave-
nue to move funds internationally.

PREPAID CARDS AND THEIR
FINANCIAL CRIME RISKS
Also  called  “stored  value  cards,”  these  are  an
increasingly popular way of carrying, transmitting
and moving value. Hundreds of billions of dollars
move worldwide through prepaid cards each year.

There are several types of prepaid cards. Some are
called “closed loop,” meaning they are issued by a
particular business and may only be redeemed for

198

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

Prepaid  card  fraud  is  often  tied  to  credit  card
fraud in which a lost, stolen or counterfeit credit
card is used to buy or load prepaid cards, which
are sold at a discount from the value they contain.
Prepaid  cards  are  also  frequently  used  in  iden-
tity theft or account takeover schemes, in which
a  hacker  will  obtain  control  of  a  victim’s  online
bank account and use the funds to purchase pre-
paid cards, which are then retrieved by mules or
smuggled out of the country.

Because  prepaid  cards  are  easily  transported
across  national  boundaries,  they  serve  as  a  con-
venient  and  portable  money  laundering  vehi-
cle.  A  criminal  seeking  to  launder  money  can
load the card in one country, transport the card
to  another  country  and  withdraw  cash  through
ATM  machines.  It  is  a  simple,  secure  and  anon-
ymous  way  to  move  and  launder  money.  Finan-
cial  institutions,  retail  establishments  and  other
businesses  may  combat  money  laundering  and
other financial crime through prepaid cards with
systems  that  monitor  their  sale  and  usage.  The
system should issue alerts on card use, and limit
or block the use of prepaid cards that exceed the
established standards for normal use.

Understand  how  and  why  a  card  will  be  used.
While prepaid card issuers may not always collect
information or conduct due diligence to the same
extent as a bank or credit card issuer, they should
still have some recognition of the card’s intended
use  in  order  to  determine  what  customer  trans-
actions are normal and which may be suspicious.
It is important to note that transaction behavior
may be different from typical debit card or credit
card  use.  One  example  is  prepaid  payroll  cards,
in which all the stored value on the card may be
deposited or withdrawn at once.

Monitor  load  activity  and  set  parameters  how
cards can be loaded and for number of reloads in
a given timeframe. This is one of the most essen-
tial  steps  to  prevent  prepaid  cards  from  being
used  in  money  laundering  schemes.  Restrict-
ing  the  total  amount  that  can  be  loaded  onto  a

goods and services at that business. Closed loop
cards usually may not be reloaded after their ini-
tial value is consumed.

“Open  loop  cards”  have  no  specific  business,  ser-
vice  or  product  they  must  be  used  for,  and  can
typically be utilized at any business that accepts
credit or debit cards. They often may be used for
ATM transactions and are normally reloadable. In
most cases, open loop cards are issued through a
bank  and  use  the  networks  of  major  credit  card
companies,  such  as  American  Express,  Master-
Card  and  Visa.  They  are  usually  restricted  for
use  with  merchants  that  accept  the  respective
credit cards.

Like  any  other  mechanism  to  store  and  transfer
value,  prepaid  cards  are  susceptible  to  exploita-
tion  by  financial  criminals.  Several  attributes  of
prepaid cards make them an attractive avenue for
fraudsters and money launderers. They can be a
highly  portable  means  to  carry  a  large  amount
of  funds,  and  are  usually  difficult  to  distinguish
from  a  standard  bank-issued  credit  or  debit
card. In some jurisdictions, they can be obtained
with  fewer  customer  due  diligence  procedures
than  would  be  conducted  when  opening  a  bank
account or applying for a credit card. Some juris-
dictions  have  few  regulations  on  prepaid  cards,
allowing  prepaid  providers  to  issue  cards  paid
for in cash, with little information collected from
the purchaser.

card, and restricting or not allowing the card to
be reloaded, limits the ability to store and move
large  amounts  of  value.  Again,  these  thresholds
and  load  monitoring  systems  should  be  tailored
to  the  intended  use  of  the  card  and  the  type  of
customer.  If  reloads  are  allowed,  prepaid  issu-
ers typically should limit the amount that can be
loaded onto the card in a given timeframe.

Be  able  to  identify  the  source  and  location  of
loads  and  reloads.  Prepaid  providers  should
monitor  the  geographic  location  and  flag  or
potentially  block  cards  loaded  or  reloaded  from
unexpected  and  high-risk  jurisdictions.  They
should  also  have  mechanisms  in  place  to  know
the source of reloads, whether that is cash, credit
card, wire transfer or money order.

Monitor the number and type of cards issued to
any given customer. A customer holding dozens
or hundreds of prepaid cards without any compel-
ling business reason would obviously raise major
red flags. Issuers should track the cards it issues
to customers and place limits as appropriate.

Conduct due diligence to understand all parties
involved in the issuance of cards in a prepaid pro-
gram. Prepaid cards are typically issued by banks,
many  of  which  are  smaller  regional  institutions.
These  banks  often  outsource  the  actual  opera-
tions and maintenance of their card programs to
third parties, including the compliance function.
Whether the financial crime specialist is advising
a prepaid issuer or investigating a case involving
prepaid  cards,  they  should  understand  who  ulti-
mately controls cardholder information, and who
is responsible for supervising compliance.

Prepaid  card  issuers  must  also  be  alert  to  the
responsibility  of  suspicious  activity  reporting
requirements.  Some  jurisdictions  require  suspi-
cious  activity  reports  to  be  filed  with  the  perti-
nent authorities on prepaid activity, similar to the
requirements on other financial transactions.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

EMERGING PAYMENT METHODS AND THEIR
FINANCIAL CRIME RISKS
In  Kenya,  a  trader  in  precious  metals  buys  and
sells  gold  using  funds  stored  on  his  cell  phone.
In  Germany,  a  customer  buys  electronic  goods
over the internet with Bitcoins. In the US, a user
of  Second  Life  uploads  funds  into  an  in-game
account in order to purchase virtual items.

 All of these scenarios are examples of emerging
technologies  to  move  and  transmit  funds  called
“new  payment  methods”  by  the  Financial  Action
Task  Force.  Online  communication  tools,  social
and gaming networks, and mobile devices such as
smart  phones  and  tablets,  are  opening  up  more
avenues  for  storing  and  transferring  value  than
ever  before.  Many  of  these  payment  methods
are  either  so  new  as  to  be  entirely  unregulated,
or intentionally designed in such a way that they
can be used anonymously. As such, the attraction
for financial criminals is obvious, especially as the
web-based nature of many of these tools makes it
possible to move funds internationally with only
a computer and a little creativity.

It is difficult to judge the financial crime risks of
these  new  payment  methods,  as  most  have  only
been in existence a handful of years. Despite the
attention  they  have  received  from  some  compli-
ance professionals and law enforcement agencies,
there are very few well-documented cases of the
proceeds of financial crime moving through ven-
ues like mobile payments and virtual currencies.
With  that  said,  it  is  still  important  for  the  finan-
cial  crime  specialist  to  understand  these  meth-
ods and recognize their potential vulnerabilities.
As  they  continue  to  grow  in  use  and  amount  of
value  being  transferred,  it  is  almost  inevitable
that they will be exploited by financial criminals
in some capacity.

MOBILE PAYMENTS
It  is  estimated  that  in  2012,  roughly  1.5  billion
people had direct access to a financial institution,
yet there were more than five billion cell phones.
With phones and other mobile technology prolif-

erating, the potential to transfer, send or receive
funds  through  mobile  devices,  or  “mobile  pay-
ments,”  represents  a  rapidly  growing  new  finan-
cial service.

Currently,  mobile  payment  systems  are  most
common  in  developing  countries  like  the  Philip-
pines, Ghana and especially Kenya, where access
to banks or other traditional financial services is
often limited. Depending on the size and sophis-
tication  of  the  system,  mobile  payments  can
be  used  to  deposit  and  withdraw  funds  from
accounts,  transfer  funds  between  phones,  and
buy  goods  and  services.  Some  employers  will
even pay their employees directly to their phones.
Mobile  payments  have  also  become  a  popular
means  for  emigrants  to  remit  payments  back  to
their home countries.

Perhaps  the  best  example  of  a  mobile  payment
system in action is Kenya’s M-PESA. Launched in
2007,  M-PESA  relies  on  a  network  of  more  than
100,000 small businesses, who register as agents
with the mobile payment system. An M-PESA user
can  then  bring  cash  to  these  agents,  who  will
then  exchange  it  for  virtual  value  credited  to  a
user’s M-PESA account. Users can then exchange
this  value  with  other  M-PESA  users,  buy  items
at some stores and restaurants, or withdraw the
value  as  cash  at  another  agent.  As  of  late  2012,
more  than  $1  billion  was  transferred  through
M-PESA each month.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

One risk of such a system is “digital value smurf-
ing,”  which  simply  means  using  multiple  money
mules  or  “smurfs”  to  make  small  cash  depos-
its  of  financial  crime  proceeds  into  their  mobile
accounts.  Once  the  money  is  in  the  mobile  pay-
ment  system,  the  smurfs  can  then  transfer  the
virtual value into an account controlled by a laun-
derer or other financial criminal.

Such a scheme has none of the typical difficulties
associated  with  bulk  cash  smuggling.  Because
many  mobile  payment  networks  are  relatively
unregulated,  it  could  also  evade  currency  and
transaction  reporting  requirements  placed  on
more traditional financial institutions.

In addition, mobile payment systems may make it
easier for launderers and other financial criminals
to erase their tracks, as they usually leave behind
fewer  records  than  more  established  financial
transactions. Law enforcement would be left with
little physical evidence that a financial crime took
place, and if the mobile payments are transferred
across borders, they may lack jurisdiction to pur-
sue the financial criminal.

VALUE TRANSFER THROUGH
VIRTUAL WORLDS
As  online  role-playing  games  became  increas-
ingly popular worldwide, some began incorporat-
ing the ability to convert real-world currency into
virtual value that could be used to purchase items
in the game. As these games continued to develop,
some  of  the  larger  and  more  sophisticated  ones
spawned virtual economies where items, services
and even virtual real estate could be bought and
sold.  Critically,  some  even  developed  means  to
convert  virtual  value  back  into  real-world  funds
or other assets.

These  virtual  worlds  present  yet  another  new
avenue  that  could  be  utilized  by  money  laun-
derers. Moving value to and from a virtual world
would  allow  funds  to  easily  cross  national  bor-
ders,  and  could  be  an  effective  means  to  place
and  layer  illicit  proceeds.  Smurfs  could  create

201

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

accounts  in  virtual  worlds  and  exchange  real-
world money for virtual value, then transfer that
value to an organized crime group by purchasing
items  in  the  game  world.  Additionally,  some  vir-
tual worlds require little information from users
to  open  accounts,  allowing  financial  criminals
to  enter  these  online  communities  and  conduct
transactions with relative anonymity.

One of the oldest and most robust virtual worlds
for the exchange of real and virtual value is Sec-
ond  Life.  An  online  community  of  roughly  one
million  users  worldwide,  it  allows  users  to  cre-
ate  characters,  design  virtual  items  and  cre-
ate  in-game  buildings  and  structures.  All  these
items  and  this  real  estate  can  be  bought  and
sold,  using  an  in-game  currency  called  “Linden
Dollars,”  named  after  the  company  that  created
Second  Life.  Linden  Dollars  can  be  purchased
with  real-world  currency,  and  traded  back  into
real-world  currency  through  the  company’s  cur-
rency exchange. In 2012, roughly $119 million was
traded  on  Linden’s  currency  exchange.  Virtual
worlds  have  almost  no  oversight  from  any  regu-
latory body. As a 2012 report on currency trading
in virtual worlds from the European Central Bank
stated:  “Every  criminal  act  which  takes  place
in  the  real  world  might  also  be  reproduced  and
adapted to Second Life and probably also to other
virtual  communities.  But  the  likelihood  is  even
stronger as a result of the lack of proper regula-
tion and oversight and owing to the high degree
of anonymity that exists in these online worlds.”

DIGITAL CURRENCIES
In  October  2008,  someone  going  by  the  name
of  Satoshi  Nakamoto  published  a  paper,  which
detailed the development of a peer-to-peer elec-
tronic cash system, to a mailing list for program-
mers and cryptography researchers.

A few months later, Nakamoto released the source
code  for  the  project  outlined  in  the  paper,  and
became the first person to hold currency gener-
ated by this new system: Bitcoin.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

Less than two years later, Nakamoto ceased pub-
lic  communications  and  effectively  disappeared.
Whether  he  is  a  real  person,  a  pseudonym  used
by someone else, or a group of individuals is still
not clear. But in the years since, the Bitcoin sys-
tem has grown dramatically, launching a new era
of digital currencies.

Digital currencies existed prior to Bitcoin, some
dating back to the 1990s, and the name can refer
to  a  wide  variety  of  electronic  money  and  value
transfer systems. Some of the earliest digital cur-
rencies were systems that allowed users to open
and  fund  accounts  tied  to  the  price  of  gold  or
other precious metals, and conduct transactions
with  other  users.  More  recently,  “decentralized”
digital  currencies  based  on  mathematical  sys-
tems, like Bitcoin, have risen to prominence.

Since  their  beginning,  digital  currencies  have
attracted  vocal  supporters  who  claim  they  are
the  future  of  money  and  payments,  and  equally
vocal critics who argue they mostly exist for illicit
transactions.  To  date,  both  sides  seem  partially
right. Some digital currencies are innovative and
have  potentially  far-reaching  applications.  But
like  any  system  that  can  be  used  to  store  and
transfer value, they are also vulnerable to use by
money  launderers,  cybercriminals  and  terror-
ist financiers.

The  FATF  uses  the  terms  “virtual  currency”  and
interchangeably.  It  defines
“digital  currency”
these  currencies  as  “a  digital  representation  of
value  that  can  be  digitally  traded  and  functions
as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/
or a store of value.

The  FATF  notes  that  digital  currencies  are  not
issued  or  backed  by  any  country  or  jurisdiction
– they hold value only due to their acceptance by
a  user  community.  Digital  currencies  are  sepa-
rate and distinct from “fiat” currencies, the real-
world  money  issued  by  national  governments.
Some  digital  currencies,  in  fact,  were  originally
intended  by  their  creators  as  replacements  for

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

fiat currencies. In broad terms, digital currencies
can be divided into two types of systems.

CENTRALIZED CURRENCIES
Centralized currencies exist on their own propri-
etary platform and are operated by a single com-
pany or person, usually referred to as the adminis-
trator. While users hold accounts and can initiate
transactions,  the  administrator  sets  the  rules  of
the  system  and  acts  as  an  intermediary  to  pro-
cess transactions and maintain a payment ledger.

Most centralized currencies are “closed-loop” or
non-convertible, meaning they can only be used
for transactions on a specific platform. Some are
“open-loop”  or  convertible,  meaning  they  can  be
exchanged  for  fiat  currencies.  Common  exam-
ples  of  closed-loop  systems  are  the  currencies
used  to  buy  and  sell  items  in  online  games  and
virtual worlds.

Users  can  transfer  real-world  money  onto
accounts  in  these  closed-loop  systems  and  con-
duct  transactions  between  users  of  the  system,
but  typically  cannot  spend  or  convert  the  cur-
rency outside of the platform.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

By their nature, centralized systems are more eas-
ily  subjected  to  regulatory  oversight  or  enforce-
ment. One person or entity administers them, in
some  cases  running  the  platform  off  of  a  hand-
ful of servers. If the person behind the system is
arrested, or the servers seized, a centralized cur-
rency can essentially disappear overnight.

Closed-loop currencies are less at risk for money
laundering  than  open-loop  or  convertible  ones,
and  their  use  in  financial  crime  schemes  is  gen-
erally  limited  to  smaller  transactions  by  low-
er-level criminals.

However,  savvy  financial  criminals  have  fig-
ured out ways to exploit even seemingly obscure
value transfer systems for their own benefit, and
closed-loop  digital  currencies  are  no  exception.
Secondary  markets  or  unauthorized  exchanges
have  developed  around  some  non-convertible
currencies,  allowing  users  to  convert  virtual
funds back into fiat currency.

DECENTRALIZED CURRENCIES
Decentralized  currencies  do  not  have  an  admin-
istrator, and there is no single entity that controls
them.  Instead,  they  operate  on  a  peer-to-peer
model.  The  platform  that  maintains  and  admin-
isters  the  currency  is  distributed  between  the
users,  and  its  rules  and  operations  are  estab-
lished by its programming.

Most  decentralized  currencies  are  also  “cryp-
tocurrencies.”  This  means  that  their  operations
are  based  on  principles  originally  developed  in
the  cryptography  field.  Cryptocurrencies  rely
on cryptographic keys to transfer value between
users,  and  validate  the  transaction.  The  sys-
tem’s  programming  maintains  a  ledger  of  trans-
actions.  This  ledger  is  supported  and  secured
by  mathematical  operations  conducted  by  the
users themselves.

This  description  of  cryptocurrencies  is  simpli-
fied,  as  a  full  technical  explanation  of  crypto-
currency  operations  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this

203

manual.  However,  while  they  may  sound  com-
plex,  most  cryptocurrencies  are  fairly  simple  to
obtain and use.

Bitcoin  has  become  the  de  facto  standard  for
cryptocurrencies,  although  there  are  many  oth-
ers inspired by Bitcoin that have tried to present
themselves as modified or improved versions. As
of  early  2018,  some  of  the  more  popular  crypto-
currencies after Bitcoin were Ethereum, Litecoin,
Zcash, Dash, Ripple and Monero.

The  most  common  way  that  users  obtain  Bit-
coins,  or  other  cryptocurrencies,  is  through  an
exchange.  These  exchanges  operate  similarly  to
securities  trading  accounts,  with  the  prices  of
currencies  constantly  changing.  Exchanges  gen-
erally will require a users’ real name and contact
information, and conduct customer due diligence
before opening an account.

Customers  can  then  purchase  digital  curren-
cies  through  bank  accounts  or  credit  or  debit
cards.  Some  exchanges  also  provide  wallets  or
electronic  storage  for  a  user’s  Bitcoins.  Users
can also create their own wallet online. A wallet
comes with a unique address that allows users to
receive Bitcoins.

Once  they  have  obtained  and  stored  Bitcoins,
users can transfer payments using the recipient’s
public address, purchase items from retailers who
accept Bitcoin, buy gift cards, or even exchange
Bitcoins for other digital currencies. There were
nearly 100,000 retailers that accepted Bitcoin as
of mid-2017.

There  are  several  other  ways  to  obtain  Bitcoins
and  other  digital  currencies  besides  purchasing
them from an exchange, including through “min-
ing.” In simple terms, mining involves using com-
puting power to solve complex mathematical for-
mulas, and is an integral part of how Bitcoin and
some other cryptocurrencies operate.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

Mining  helps  process  transactions  in  Bitcoin,
and  maintains  the  currency’s  open  payment  led-
ger,  or  “blockchain.”  It  is  also  how  new  Bitcoins
are  released  into  circulation.  Through  its  pro-
gramming, Bitcoin has a cap on the total number
of  Bitcoins  that  will  be  brought  into  circulation,
at 21 million.

Resolving the mathematical puzzles required for
mining  takes  substantial  computational  power.
To  incentivize  mining,  the  system  rewards  min-
ers with a small transaction fee. When a new Bit-
coin is periodically released into circulation, the
miner who unlocks that Bitcoin also receives it as
a reward. Mining has become significantly more
difficult over time, due to the programming con-
straints of Bitcoin. Some other cryptocurrencies
also  rely  on  mining  as  part  of  their  operations,
while others use different models.

Because setting up accounts on digital currency
platforms is often a quick and easy process that
can  be  done  online,  these  systems  lend  them-
selves  to  “micro-laundering.”  A  launderer  may
open  multiple  different  accounts  under  his  con-
trol  on  a  currency  platform,  and  use  them  to
send  many  different  small-value  payments  to
other recipients.

This  technique  takes  advantage  of  the  ability  to
conduct  rapid  or  instantaneous  payments  using
digital currencies. W the amounts transmitted in
each payment may be very small, a criminal can
move large sums quickly by conducting hundreds
or even thousands of low-level transactions.

CRYPTOCURRENCY AND MONEY
LAUNDERING RISKS
Why would a money launderer, fraudster or other
financial criminal decide to use a cryptocurrency?
After all, there are established money laundering
channels that are proven to be effective, and pay-
ment systems like money remitters have transac-
tion fees that are comparable or lower than many
cryptocurrency exchanges.

Furthermore,  cryptocurrencies  are  a  tradable
asset.  Speculation  on  cryptocurrency  markets
can lead to large fluctuations in their price, and
their value tends to be less stable than many real-
world currencies and investments like real estate.
Although  their  acceptance  by  retailers  and  even
some  financial  institutions  is  growing,  the  abil-
ity to convert cryptocurrencies into cash, or use
them to buy goods and services, is still more lim-
ited than real-world currencies.

However, there are key features of cryptocurren-
cies  that  may  make  them  attractive  to  the  crim-
inal element:

ANONYMITY
Much of the concern from law enforcement and
regulators has focused on the potential for largely
anonymous transactions using cryptocurrencies.

Many  exchanges  will  conduct  customer  due  dil-
igence,  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the  funds
coming  into  customer  accounts.  Once  funds
move  from  real-world  currencies  into  crypto-
currencies,  however,  they  become  much  more
difficult  to  trace  back  to  a  real  person.  Once  a
customer has transferred Bitcoins purchased on
an exchange into his wallet, the transaction trail
is  obscured  from  the  eyes  of  law  enforcement
and regulators.

At  this  point,  cryptocurrency  transactions  act
similarly to transactions in cash. Users can trans-
fer currency to other users, buy goods or services
or  store  currency  in  an  online  or  offline  wallet
with little to no reporting or audit trail.

Although exchanges require a user to provide his
real identity, wallets typically do not – many can
be opened using only an email address and alias
or fake name. Wallets can be held on a user’s own
device,  such  as  a  computer,  phone  or  even  USB
drive.  Addresses  tied  to  these  wallets,  and  used
to transact in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,
can be hard to link back to an individual or entity.

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

Unlike  cash,  digital  currency  users  do  not  need
to  physically  move  large  volumes  of  currency
or  be  in  the  same  area  to  conduct  transactions.
This ability to conduct cross-border transactions,
without  the  use  of  financial  institutions  and  the
regulatory  oversight  that  comes  with  them,  is
another  reason  why  financial  criminals  might
exploit cryptocurrencies.

It is worth noting that there is a major caveat in
Bitcoin’s perceived anonymity. All transactions in
Bitcoin  are  stored  on  its  public  ledger,  or  block-
chain.  If  someone  –  for  example,  a  law  enforce-
ment agent – knows the addresses of the sender
or  recipient,  they  can  theoretically  trace  the
transaction through the blockchain.

In  2015,  agents  with  the  FBI  and  IRS  Criminal
Investigations  Division  were  able  to  trace  nearly
4,000  Bitcoin  transactions  to  Silk  Road,  a  noto-
rious  online  drug  bazaar.  This  tracing  was  pos-
sible  after  agents  seized  a  laptop  containing
the  personal  addresses  of  Ross  Ulbricht,  Silk
Road’s  owner  and  operator,  and  analyzed  these
addresses against the blockchain.

For  this  reason,  Bitcoin  is  often  referred  to  as
pseudo-anonymous.  Even  if  a  transaction  is
traced,  it  can  be  challenging  to  tie  an  address
back  to  its  true  owner,  and  requires  extensive
investigation.

SPEED AND IRREVOCABILITY
An individual who orders a wire transfer for pay-
ment  to  a  recipient  overseas  may  have  to  wait
several  days  for  the  transaction  to  clear.  During
that  time,  the  bank  will  conduct  due  diligence
checks  on  the  customer  and  recipient,  and  the
transaction could be cancelled or reversed if it is
found to be fraudulent or in violation of sanctions.

Cryptocurrency  transactions  have  no  such  lim-
itations.  Once  initiated,  the  currency  leaves  one
user’s  wallet,  is  processed  through  the  ledger,
and  enters  the  recipient’s  wallet  in  a  matter  of
minutes  or  less.  Transactions  are  usually  irrevo-

cable.  Like  a  cash  payment,  there  is  no  built-in
mechanism to reverse a cryptocurrency payment
unless the recipient simply agrees to return it.

Many  exchanges  and  service  providers  will
respond to user complaints, and may shut down
accounts  suspected  of  illicit  activity.  But  the
decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies means
there is no single administrator to police transac-
tions or field appeals from users.

From the perspective of a criminal conducting an
online  fraud  scheme,  this  makes  cryptocurren-
cies an appealing option. Online Ponzi and pyra-
mid schemes will often ask for payment in Bitcoin
or other cryptocurrencies, ensuring the fraudster
receives his funds quickly and defrauded custom-
ers have little ability to recover them. The same is
true for cybercriminals offering hacking skills or
malware,  or  sellers  of  narcotics  or  illegal  goods,
who  want  to  ensure  they  will  be  paid  without

mation to buyers.

INCONSISTENT REGULATION AND
ENFORCEMENT OF DIGITAL CURRENCIES
In  the  early  days  of  digital  currencies,  lawmak-
ers and regulators in many jurisdictions seemed
baffled  by  what  to  make  of  this  strange  new
phenomenon.  Cryptocurrencies  seemed  espe-
cially confusing.

Some  countries  ignored  them,  some  outlawed
their use entirely, and still others debated whether
they  were  even  a  financial  asset  that  should  be
subject to regulation. That debate continues, but
some nations have adopted a framework for reg-
ulating  parts  of  the  digital  currency  world.  The
most  common  approach  has  been  to  focus  on
regulation  of  digital  currency  administrators
and exchanges.

In the US, Canada and European Union, for exam-
ple, administrators and exchanges are considered
to  a  form  of  money  services  business,  and  sub-
ject  to  the  same  AML  regulation  as  other  MSBs.
This  includes  customer  due  diligence,  transac-
tion  monitoring,  reporting  and  record-keeping
requirements. Globally, the regulatory framework
for  digital  currencies  remains  inconsistent  and
varied.  Some  countries  still  do  not  regulate  dig-
ital currency exchanges; others have regulations
on  the  books  but  do  not  seem  to  enforce  them.
Whether and how individuals have to report their
digital  currencies  for  tax  purposes  is  also  unre-
solved in many countries.

CRIMINAL USE OF DIGITAL CURRENCIES
AND THE DARK WEB
If  digital  currencies  are  vulnerable  to  use  by
financial criminals, there is an obvious question:
What are criminals using them to do?

Much  concern  about  digital  currencies  has
focused on their potential for money laundering
by transnational organized crime groups and ter-
rorist financiers. As of mid-2017, researchers and

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

law  enforcement  have  found  infrequent  though
growing  use  by  organized  crime  rings,  and  lim-
ited cases involving terrorist financing.

In  July  2017,  a  report  by  the  European  Commis-
sion noted that use by organized crime was “quite
rare”  at  that  time,  and  suggested  that  digital
currencies  presented  a  higher  bar  for  entry  and
were  less  convenient  than  other  money  laun-
dering methods.

Digital currencies are widely used in markets for
illegal goods and services online, however. Digital
currencies  have  become  the  preferred  payment
method  for  illicit  online  transactions,  especially
on  the  dark  web.  The  “dark  web”  describes  an
Internet  network  that  exists  outside  of  the  “sur-
face  web,”  or  the  online  world  that  most  people
typically  interact  with  through  their  browser.
The dark web can only be accessed through spe-
cialized software and is not discoverable through
search engines or web indexing tools.

The  largest  and  perhaps  most  well-known  dark
web is accessible through The Onion Router (Tor),
an online anonymity tool. Tor is free software that
anyone  can  download.  It  was  initially  developed
to help persons in repressive countries access the
Internet and avoid government censorship.

It  directs  an  individual’s  online  activity  through
a network of more than 7,000 relays, disguising a
user’s true location and making it difficult to con-
duct online surveillance on a user. Web sites can
be configured so that they are accessible only to
computers  running  Tor  software.  This  has  cre-
ated a hidden online environment shielded from
the public view of the surface web.

Much of its dark web is innocuous. There are per-
sonal websites, blogs and even social media sites
similar  to  Facebook,  but,  inevitably,  criminals
have also been drawn to the dark web. There are
forums  where  credit  card  fraudsters  trade  tips
and share skills, and others where cybercriminals
discuss new malware and attack techniques and

offer suggestions on easy targets. Criminal actors
have  also  set  up  dark  web  marketplaces,  where
a vast array of illegal goods and services can be
purchased using cryptocurrencies.

Many well-trafficked illicit bazaars in the Tor dark
web,  such  as  Silk  Road,  Silk  Road  2.0  and  Alpha-
Bay, have been closed by law enforcement or shut
down  by  their  own  creators.  Yet  each  time,  oth-
ers open up to take their place.

These  marketplaces  act  as  a  middleman,  provid-
ing  the  online  platform  to  connect  sellers  and
buyers.  Many  will  mimic  the  functionality  and
even  the  appearance  of  legitimate  surface-web
retail  sites,  such  as  eBay  or  Amazon.  Markets
may specialize in one type of good or service, but
larger ones will usually have a variety of offerings.

Cryptocurrencies  have  enabled
these  dark
markets  to  thrive.  The  ability  to  conduct  rapid
cross-border payments that do not require trust
between  buyer  and  seller  makes  cryptocurren-
cies ideal for illicit online transactions. Most mar-
ketplaces  only  use  Bitcoin  or  other  cryptocur-
rency as their payment mechanism.

DIGITAL CURRENCY COMPLIANCE
CONSIDERATIONS
Along  with  overtly  criminal  marketplaces,  there
are  thousands  of  legitimate  merchants  who
accept  digital  currencies,  on  both  the  dark  web
and  surface  web.  They  range  from  global  cor-
porations such as Microsoft and Dell and online
retailers  such  as  Overstock  to  travel  sites  such
as  Expedia,  along  with  many  smaller  sites  and
stores. Some bars and restaurants have adopted
Bitcoin  payments.  Even  some  political  parties
and non-profits have begun taking donations via
cryptocurrency.

As  digital  currencies  become  more  mainstream
and more merchants start accepting them, crim-
inals  who  transact  in  cryptocurrencies  have
more outlets to use their illicit proceeds. Even so,
criminal actors may still want, or need, to convert

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

digital  currencies  back  into  real-world  funds  to
bankroll ongoing operations or enjoy their ill-got-
ten gains. This creates an interface with financial
institutions  and  raises  compliance  concerns  for
AML professionals.

Banks and other financial institutions should con-
sider monitoring their customer accounts for sig-
nificantly large or frequent funds transfers to and
from  digital  currency  exchanges.  These  transac-
tion patterns could indicate potential illicit activ-
ity involving digital currency.

At  the  same  time,  institutions  should  recog-
nize  that  there  is  nothing  inherently  suspicious
about  purchasing  or  transacting  in  digital  cur-
rencies.  Most  customers  are  likely  to  be  moving
funds to a digital currency exchange for a legiti-
mate purpose.

Specific digital currencies rise and fall in promi-
nence, and some have disappeared completely.

However,  the  concepts  underlying  digital  cur-
rencies,  especially  the  decentralized  public  led-
ger or blockchain, are here to stay. As innovation
continues  and  mainstream  use  increases,  block-
chain applications are poised to expand into the
new  fields,  and  digital  currencies  seem  likely
to  become  a  widely  accepted  part  of  the  global
financial system.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND
FINANCIAL FLOWS
A lucrative and rapidly growing criminal activity,
human  trafficking  is  by  most  estimates  second
only  to  drug  trafficking  in  its  global  scale  and
profitability.

On  the  positive  side,  awareness  of  the  issue
has  greatly  increased  in  recent  years,  as  have
resources  to  train  financial  crime  professionals
to  spot  illicit  financial  flows  tied  to  human  traf-
ficking.  Some  countries  have  also  seen  positive
results  combatting  human  trafficking  with  ini-

208

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

tiatives  to  increase  cooperation  and  informa-
tion-sharing  between  law  enforcement  and  the
financial sector, such as Project Protect in Canada.

Despite  these  advances,  the  statistics  behind
human trafficking remain staggering. In 2017, the
International  Labor  Organization  estimated  that
forced labor generated more than $150 billion per
year  from  nearly  25  million  people  in  involun-
tary  servitude.  Of  those  people,  the  largest  por-
tion – 16 million - were in forced labor in private
sector  work  like  agriculture,  construction  and
domestic  service.  An  additional  4.8  million  were
in forced sexual exploitation, while the remaining
4.1 million were in forced labor from government
authorities.

A  2016  report  by  the  United  Nations  Office  on
Drugs  and  Crime,  Global  Trafficking  in  Persons,
found that 71% of victims were female, though the
proportion of male victims had grown rapidly in
recent  years.  The  report  also  found  that  28%  of
victims were children.

A  growing  body  of  research  and  intelligence  on
human  trafficking  has  led  to  a  more  nuanced
understanding  of  its  financial  footprint,  which
can vary widely based on the type of trafficking
and exploitation that is taking place. Human traf-
ficking schemes are diverse, and how they regis-
ter as incoming and outgoing financial flows can
be very different depending on the details of the
scheme, including factors like:

•  The recruitment and transportation

mechanisms used for trafficked individuals,
ranging from forcible abduction to false
promises of employment, immigration or
even marriage.

•  Whether the perpetrators are operating

domestically or internationally

•  How the perpetrators benefit from trafficking

and exploitation – For example, whether
funds are taken from victims of forced labor
in cash, or whether wages are stolen after

CHAPTER 10 • MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOW

being deposited in a bank account, or by
other methods.

As  such,  there’s  no  “one-size-fits-all”  approach
to  detecting  and  preventing  human  trafficking
within the context of a financial crime compliance
program, nor one comprehensive list of red flags.

For  this  reason,  it’s  important  for  financial  insti-
tutions and other organizations to consider their
exposure  to  human  trafficking  as  part  of  risk
assessment,  and  to  drill  down  on  the  specific
types  of  trafficking  they  may  be  dealing  with.
Should an institution on focus personal accounts
that may be held by victims of sex trafficking, or
business  accounts  being  utilized  by  companies
abusing  forced  labor?  For  non-financial  compa-
nies, are there human trafficking risks within the
supply chain?

A thorough assessment can help respond to these
questions. Some factors to consider can include:

•  Geographic region – Is the institution

providing services in a jurisdiction with high
prevalence of trafficked individuals, or in a
human trafficking corridor? Reports from
the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, FATF, the
US State Department and others can help
identify higher-risk regions.

•  Customer type – Business types at higher
risk for use in sexual exploitation have
historically included massage parlors, online
and print classified ad providers, bars and
nightclubs, and hotels/hospitality industry
providers, among others.

Business types at risk for forced labor
commonly include agriculture, low-skills
manufacturing, construction services,
transportation service providers, and labor
brokers or recruiters, especially those
focused on seasonal or transient work.

•  Products and services – Like any financial
criminal, human traffickers are versatile
opportunists, and will rely on nearly any
financial service that is accessible and

panied by a third party. This third party may pur-
port  to  be  a  translator,  and  often  possesses  the
client’s identification.

While such may never show up in an alert, a well-
trained staff member could quickly raise the issue
to compliance staff for further investigation.

Other  transactional  activity  that  could  be  red
flags of human trafficking includes:

•  Customers that cash payroll checks, then

remit all or the majority of funds back to an
employer account

•  Accounts that appear to operate as funnel

accounts, which receive cash deposits from
states, cities or regions outside of where the
accountholder resides

•  Low cost, high-volume transactions related

to transportation and logistics

•  Common telephone numbers or emails
between multiple (seemingly unrelated)
customer’s accounts

•  A customer with no clear full-time
employment, despite significant
account turnover

•  Accounts with frequent transactions to
classified advertising sites/services

•  Accounts that are tied to customers at the
same address receive funds that are then
immediately withdrawn in cash

•  Accounts for individuals that have deposits
coming in, but no living expenses – E.g.
no transactional activity related to food
purchases, rent, credit card payments, etc.

convenient. Historically, schemes have
operated with prepaid cards, cash and
money orders to take funds from victims
and finance operations, though the use of
personal bank accounts is also common.

More recently, law enforcement agencies in
some countries have an increase in the use of
digital currencies and email money transfers,
such as those offered by Paypal, in sexual
exploitation cases. In one case in Canada,
victims of sexual exploitation were being paid
in bitcoin and email money transfers, which
once received were immediately sent to
another account.

RED FLAGS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING
As  research  and  reporting  on  human  trafficking
have  advanced,  so  too  have  the  resources  from
regulators  and  international  organizations  that
are  available  to  support  compliance  programs
and  investigations.  The  links  highlighted  below
are just a few examples:

•  FATF Report – Financial Flows from Human
Trafficking (2018) – Includes statistics and
descriptions, case studies, and red flags

•  FinCEN Advisory - Guidance on Recognizing

Activity that May be Associated with
Human Smuggling and Human Trafficking
(2014) – Includes a compendium of red flags
organized by type of financial institution

•  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
– Human Trafficking Knowledge Portal -

updated on an ongoing basis

It’s worth noting that front line staff can be very
important  watchdogs  for  detecting  suspicious
activity  tied  to  human  trafficking.  For  example,

account  or  conducts  transactions  while  accom-

COMPLIANCE
PROGRAMS
AND
CONTROLS

OVERVIEW

In simple terms, compliance programs of financial institutions

and  other  corporations  are  aimed  at  assuring  that  the  organi-

zation  complies  with  the  statutory,  regulatory  and  other  gov-

ernmental requirements that apply in a particular field. In the

financial crime arena, because of a strong public policy against

permitting  financial  institutions  and  other  corporations  from

being  used  and  abused  for  the  commission  or  facilitation  of

crime,  a  great  deal  of  laws  and  regulations  over  the  past  45

years have created a patchwork of requirements.

212

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

an overall unit that may be called “The Financial
Crimes  Risk  Management  Program,”  or  some-
thing similar.

How  does  one  create  such  a  program  and  the
accompanying structure?

A compliance structure for a financial crimes risk
management  program  involves  multiple  coordi-
nated functions. As with any compliance program,
its  success  requires  development,  implementa-
tion  and  ongoing  operation,  effective  corporate
oversight and the interaction of executive leader-
ship, key group and line of business leaders, com-
pliance, product managers, the legal department,
an auditing process and other employees across
the organization.

One essential element, if the organization is large
enough, is a governance function. This element of
the  overall  financial  crime  compliance  program
should set policies and have an effective and effi-
cient  method  of  implementing  them  across  the
entire  organization,  including  ways  to  handle
requests for exceptions and exemptions.

ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW OF
FINANCIAL CRIME CONTROLS
A company’s size, structure, complexity and risks
are the basis of internal controls designed to limit

These compliance programs have compelled vari-
ous business organizations to create new depart-
ments to ensure obedience with the legal require-
ments. Over time, these compliance departments
have grown dramatically in terms of the number
of people involved, the diverse occupational fields
that these people represent, and their cost to the
organization. In fact, regulatory agencies not only
review  the  operations  of  the  business  organiza-
tion  to  ensure  that  it  is  not  conducting  or  facili-
tating the particular financial crime activity that
is  the  agency’s  jurisdiction,  but  they  also  exam-
ine the compliance department to enure that it is
sufficient  to  guard  the  organization  against  the
pertinent financial crime problem.

CONVERGENCE OF FINANCIAL
CRIME FUNCTIONS
As  compliance  programs  have  grown,  so  have
their structures and focus. One of the significant
developments  in  compliance  program  manage-
ment and organization in recent years is the con-
cept of “convergence.” Just as the term “financial
crime”  connotes  an  embrace  of  distinct  compo-
nents  of  that  term,  including  corruption,  money
laundering,  fraud,  sanctions  and  related  crimes,
convergence  signifies  the  enveloping  of  distinct
financial  crime-control  functions  to  improve
effectiveness,  efficiency  and  economy  in  compli-
ance  by  business  organizations,  including  finan-
cial institutions.

Many  large,  medium  and  small  financial  institu-
tions and other corporations have embraced the
concept  of  convergence.  They  have  concluded
that  many  of  the  functions  of  distinct  financial
crime  controls  and  the  personnel  who  work  in
various  units  would  achieve  more  in  the  overall
picture as a combined unit than separately.

Later  in  this  chapter,  the  traditional  compliance
program  in  the  AML  and  other  financial  crime
fields is explained. For now, because it is the new
wave  in  financial  crime  compliance  programs,
it  is  instructive  to  explore  and  explain  the  con-
vergence  of  distinct  financial  crime  units  into

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

and  control  risks  and  achieve  compliance  with
the  appropriate  laws.  Internal  controls  are  typ-
ically  divided  into  “preventive”  and  “detective,”
although  they  are  not  strictly  linear.  In  what-
ever  names  the  controls  are  labeled,  a  program
should  be  designed  to  promote  a  strong  compli-
ance culture that provides oversight and permits
members of the group to challenge persons in the
business units and the examiners, as appropriate.

Preventive
ing and others:

controls

include

the

follow-

•  Maintaining corporate financial crimes

policy program

•  Maintaining a customer identification

and due diligence program that identifies
and prevents inappropriate people and
entities from becoming customers or a
representative in a foreign country, and has
a process to exit risky relationships after
being discovered

•  Providing appropriate training

•  Performing appropriate risk assessments and

gap analysis

•  Providing line of business reporting, issue

remediation and root cause analysis

•  Preparing useful senior management and

board reporting

•  Maintaining functions that promote liaison
with the audit unit and coordination of
examinations

Detective  controls  include  the  following  duties
and attributes:

•  Identifying suspicious activity through
unusual activity referrals by employees
or automated transaction monitoring,
customer surveillance, or other customer or
transactional monitoring tools and processes

•  Investigating the identified unusual activities

•  Monitoring customer activity, and applying
predictive analytics for customer-centric,
cross-channel fraud detection

•  Monitoring the activity of both employees
and third parties when they act on behalf
of the company

•  Screening, blocking and rejecting

transactions and customers appropriately

•  Reporting these matters (and other
regulatory reporting requirements,
including CTRs)

•  Exiting customer relationships

•  Compliance testing

Prevention
the following:

and

depend

on

•  Employees who design, build and implement

the policies and controls

•  Processes and procedures that implement
and integrate those controls in the line of
businesses and operational groups

•  Technology that leverages these employees

and processes

•  Training to ensure employees understand the

risks and controls

POLICY PROGRAM
Effectively implemented and sustainable policies
are one of the cornerstones of a strong risk man-
agement program. One way of accomplishing this
is to require central policies that lines of business
implement  by  developing  procedures  to  meet
them.  This  allows  roles  and  responsibilities  to
be clear. An effective policy program should also
include the following:

•  New policy consideration

•  Policy revisions

•  Policy implementation

•  Policy exception & exemptions processes

•  Policy gap analysis review

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

TRAINING
Training  is  an  essential  element  of  any  compli-
ance  program,  to  the  point  that  it  is  one  of  the
“five pillars” of anti-money laundering compliance
under  the  US  regulatory  regime.  Regulations
often  specify  that  covered  financial  institutions
and other companies must ensure that their per-
sonnel are trained in the laws and rules relevant
to their positions.

A  program  should  require  that  all  employees
complete  role-specific  training  tailored  to  their
jobs  and  responsibilities.  In  addition,  organiza-
tions  should  consider  supplying  employees  with
appropriate  training  on  wider  financial  crime
issues likely to affect multiple departments busi-
ness  lines  such  as  fraud,  global  anti-corruption,
cybercrime and tax evasion, among others.

Training  should  be  given  on  at  least  an  annual
basis, though many organizations use a quarterly
training model. Newly hired employees should be
required  to  complete  training  within  60  days  of
being hired.

RISK ASSESSMENTS
Risk assessments should be based on the govern-
mental  requirements  and  designed  so  that  they
are  conducted  at  a  business  unit  level  that  then
can  be  aggregated  for  other  units,  including  at
the corporate level.

For financial crimes, a risk assessment should fol-
low a documented process. It is useful to apply the
following categories to a risk assessment process:

•  Types of distribution channels used by the

business unit

•  Complexity of the business unit’s

business model

•  Degree of change in the business

•  Amount and type of growth in the business

CUSTOMER RISK-RATING
Risk  assessments  are  a  way  of  looking  at  the
inherent  and  residual  risk  of  a  line  of  business.
However, it is also important to evaluate individ-
ual  customers  by  performing  customer  risk  rat-
ings.  The  purpose  of  a  customer  risk  rating  sys-
tem  is  to  identify  those  customers  who  pose  a
higher risk to the company, and who may require
enhanced  due  diligence  or  whose  relationships
should be ended.

Risk  ratings  are  best  managed  by  a  data  ana-
lytics  group  that  can  modify  the  program  as
needed. For instance, additional risk models may
be  needed  to  account  for  product  risk,  such  as
when a customer adds a higher risk product that
changes  the  customer’s  risk  profile.  Corporate
policy  should  require  that  all  lines  of  business
use an enterprise-wide methodology to risk-rate
their  customers  to  ensure  that  customer  risk  is
evaluated  consistently  across  the  enterprise.  A
suggested model is based on a scale of 1 (lowest
risk) through 5 (highest risk) or whatever scale of
merit the organization selects.

PRODUCT RISK
Having  a  product  or  service  risk  policy  for  new
and modified offerings allows an organization to
have  a  more  comprehensive  view  of  its  overall
financial crime risks.

SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE
The  laws  of  certain  countries  impose  sanctions,
or  authorize  regulations
imposing  sanctions,
against  specific  foreign  governments,  organi-
zations  and  persons.  Sanctions  generally  pro-
hibit  transactions  with  countries,  individuals
and  organizations  and  require  that  transactions
involving  them  be  blocked.  The  laws  that  autho-
rize  sanctions  also  usually  impose  penalties  on
individuals,  financial  institutions,  or  other  busi-
nesses  and  organizations  that  conduct  transac-
tions or engage in commerce with the sanctioned
nations, individuals and organizations.

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

In essence, sanctions are a nation’s objections to
the policies or conduct of a nation, organization
or  individual.  They  include  travel  restrictions;
restrictions  or  prohibitions  of  trade,  financial
transactions or other commerce with the subject
nation; and other measures. They also authorize
the seizure or freezing of property owned or con-
trolled by the sanctioned nation, organization or

OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS
CONTROL (OFAC)
The  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control
(OFAC)  is  an  agency  of  the  United  States
Department  of  the  Treasury.  It  is  over-
seen  by  the  Under  Secretary  of  the  Trea-
sury  for  Terrorism  and  Financial  Intelli-
gence.  OFAC’s  purpose  is  to  administer
and enforce economic and trade sanctions
against  targeted  nations,  organizations,
and individuals. US sanctions are imposed
based  on  US  foreign  policy  and  national
security goals.

To  enforce  economic  sanctions,  OFAC
acts  to  prevent  “prohibited  transactions.”
These  are  described  by  OFAC  as  ‘trade
or  financial  transactions  and  other  deal-
ings in which US persons may not engage
unless  authorized  by  OFAC  or  expressly
exempted  by  statute.’  OFAC  can  grant
exemptions to prohibitions on such trans-
actions, either by issuing a general license
for  certain  categories  of  transactions,  or
by  specific  licenses  on  a  case-by-case
basis.  OFAC  essentially  relies  on  financial
institutions  and  businesses  to  enforce
its  “prohibited  transactions,  by  requiring
them to block assets and prevent transac-
tions  to  and  from  sanctioned  individuals,
organizations  and  nations.  See  the  OFAC
page  for  more  information:  www.ustreas.

person  if  it  is  situated  in  the  country  imposing
the sanctions.

In  addition  to  national  sanctions,  the  United
Nations,  through  the  UN  Security  Council,  may
ask member countries to apply sanctions against
certain countries. Some nations, such as Canada,
impose  their  own  sanctions  and  enact  domes-
tic  laws  in  response  to  UN  Security  Council
resolutions.

The  websites  of  the  foreign  ministries  or  other
appropriate  agencies  of  most  nations  contain
information  on  their  sanctions  policies  and
sanctions lists.

In the US, which has the world’s most active and
broad  sanctions  regime,  the  Office  of  Foreign
Assets  Control  (OFAC)  of  the  US  Department  of
the Treasury administers and enforces sanctions
against  nations,  drug  traffickers,  terrorists  and
persons and organizations linked to the prolifera-
tion of mass destruction weapons.

OFAC sanctions usually prohibit trade, cause the
“blocking”  of  assets,  and  prevent  financial  trans-

actions with sanctioned countries, organizations
and individuals. OFAC also imposes sanctions on
“specially  designated  nationals,”  known  as  SDNs,
whose property must be blocked. OFAC’s website,
at  www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac,
provides information on US sanctions policy and
sanctioned nations, persons and organizations.

Sanctions  regulations  are  complex  and  varied.
Penalties  for  violation  apply  to  institutions,  busi-
nesses and individuals. In the US, the maximum
prison term upon a criminal conviction is 20 years.
Civil monetary penalties may also be imposed for
each prohibited transaction.

The  sanctions  program  of  a  financial  institution
or other business must not only employ and con-
tinually  train  employees  on  sanctions  policies,
enforcement  and  compliance,  but  it  should  also
ensure  its  procedures  provide  current  infor-
mation  on  sanctions  developments  worldwide,
including  new  and  modified  sanctions.  Close
monitoring of transactions to ensure they do not
involve a sanctioned nation, individual or organi-
zation and prompt blocking of those that do, cou-
pled  with  effective  internal  reporting  and  train-
ing,  are  essential  elements  of  a  good  sanctions
compliance program.

SANCTIONS
COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS
Sanctions  programs  of  various  nations,  such  as
those managed by the US Treasury Department’s
Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  (OFAC)  or  the
UK  Treasury,  are  designed  to  block  or  prevent
the  transfer  or  use  of  funds  through  the  global
financial  system  by  certain  designated  entities
or countries. Usually, sanctions compliance is an
important  component  in  the  organization’s  over-
all AML program. Sanctions carry heavy civil and
criminal  penalties,  ranging  from  large  fines  to
criminal  prosecutions,  as  well  as  significant  rep-
utational damage.

Sanctions  program  laws  and  regulations  in  var-
ious  countries  include  a  number  of  obligations
and expectations. Principal among these are the
blocking  of  funds  and  rejecting  of  transactions
involving  sanctioned  entities  or  regimes.  Sanc-
tions lists, such as those of OFAC, consist of SDNs
and  countries,  as  well  as  economic  sanctions
against  specific  countries  or  regimes  as  part  of
specific laws.

OFAC SANCTIONS
The US has one of the most complex and actively
enforced network of sanctions laws in the world.
As  previously  mentioned,  US  sanctions  are
administered  and  enforced  by  the  Office  of  For-
eign Assets Control, or OFAC.

The  US  has  comprehensive  sanctions  in  place
against  a  number  of  countries,  which  as  of  May
2017 included Cuba, Myanmar, Iran, North Korea,
Sudan  and  Syria.  These  prohibit  most  forms  of
trade  and  financial  transactions  to  these  coun-
tries.  There  are  also  targeted  sanctions  in  place
against  over  5,000  individuals,  businesses,  non-
profits  and  entities,  including  terrorist  organiza-
tions,  drug  traffickers  and  organized  crime  fig-
ures located anywhere in the world.

Entities  that  are  owned  by  these  specially  des-
ignated nationals, or in which SDNs have a more
than 50 percent stake, must be treated as SDNs.
All  US  citizens,  corporations  and  legal  entities
must comply with US sanctions. In addition, any
person or entity physically located in the US must
comply with US sanctions, including branches of
non-US financial institutions located in the US.

The  procedures  that  institutions  use  to  enforce
US  sanctions  on  financial  transactions  will  vary
somewhat depending on the terms of the specific
law  imposing  that  sanction.  In  general,  however,
institutions will follow these steps:

•  The originator and recipient of a transaction

are screened against lists of sanctioned
countries and SDNs.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

217

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

•  Transactions that match an entry on the

sanctions list must be “blocked,” or prevented,
from being processed. The funds must
be placed in a separate, interest-bearing
account at the institution.

•  Based on OFAC recommendations,

institutions should conduct a thorough
review against a variety of information
sources and databases, or contact OFAC
directly, before blocking a transaction.
Institutions should only block transactions
if there is an exact match with an entity
or individual on a sanctions list. Partial
or inconclusive matches are not sufficient
grounds to block a transaction.

•  The institution must submit a blocking
reporting with OFAC within 10 days of
blocking the transaction.

•  The institution cannot notify the person,

company or organization that the transaction
has been blocked.

Depending  on  their  specific  provisions,  OFAC
sanctions  may  sometimes  require  a  US  institu-
tion  to  freeze  assets.  This  may  occur,  for  exam-
ple, when an institution screens existing account
holders against a sanctions list and discovers one
of its account holders is a match with an entity on
an  SDN  list.  In  that  case,  the  institution  may  be

required to freeze the entire account and report
its actions to OFAC.

Even  non-US  institutions  with  very  limited  US
operations, or only one branch in the US to con-
duct dollar-clearing transactions, must still com-
ply  with  US  sanctions.  Failure  to  comply  with
OFAC  sanctions  can  incur  very  high  monetary
and  criminal  penalties,  including  up  to  20  years
in prison for individuals.

This  fact  has  been  vividly  demonstrated  by
enforcement actions recent years, including in a
major  sanctions  case  against  British  bank  Stan-
dard  Chartered  that  ended  in  nearly  $800  mil-
lion  paid  to  US  state  and  national  enforcement
agencies.  Standard  Chartered  was  based  almost
entirely outside the US, but had one office in New
York that it used only for clearing transactions in
US  dollars.  The  fact  that  it  routed  transactions
that violated US sanctions through this office was
sufficient to trigger liability.

EU SANCTIONS
The European Union also issues a wide range of
sanctions  on  countries,  individuals  and  entities.
While  EU  sanctions  are  intended  to  be  policy
guiding member states, it is still left up to individ-
ual EU countries to implement these measures. In
some cases, the level of enforcement of EU sanc-
tions varies between member nations.

Like OFAC sanctions, EU sanctions include a wide
array  of  restrictive  measures.  Some  examples
include the following:

•  Trade restrictions, such as arms and

technology embargoes to certain countries

•  Bans or limitations on providing services or

technical assistance

•  Restrictions or bans on EU financial

institutions providing loans, trade finance
or other financial assistance to sanctioned
countries or entities

appropriate transactions

Generally, EU sanctions tend to be more targeted
against certain persons and entities, and are typ-
ically  not  blanket  measures  on  a  country-wide
level. OFAC sanctions, on the other hand, tend to
be  more  comprehensive,  banning  all  business  or
financial  transactions  with  sanctioned  individu-
als and entities.

EU  sanctions  apply  to  any  persons  or  entities
either  physically  located  or  incorporated  in  the
EU.  They  also  apply  to  any  business  conducted
“whole or in part” within the EU by any person or
entity,  regardless  of  their  nationality.  Like  OFAC
sanctions, they also apply to foreign subsidiaries
of EU-based companies or entities.

In  regard  to  financial  accounts,  some  EU  sanc-
tions  will  require  financial  institutions  to  freeze
the accounts or assets they hold for a customer if
the institution discovers that customer is a match
with a person or entity on the EU sanctions list.

ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A SANCTIONS
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
In recent years, sanctions around the world have
been one of the most active areas in compliance.
Many  new  names  have  been  added  to  sanctions
lists, including individuals and firms linked to ter-
rorist organizations, drug dealers and cartels, and
specific  sanctioned  countries.  Sanctions  com-
pliance  programs,  coupled  with  active  enforce-
ment  by  pertinent  government  agencies,  are  an
effective tool in reducing the money that reaches
these types of individuals and organizations.

A  sound  sanctions  compliance  program  should
include  the  following  components,  according  to
widely accepted best practices:

•  Development and implementation of
policies, procedures and processes to
ensure full compliance with all sanctions
prohibitions, including:

 » Adequate controls to identify and terminate
correspondent and other relationships with
banks, vendors, partners and other entities
whose owners have links to, or present
a high risk of involvement with, terrorist
financing or corruption

•  Becoming knowledgeable about the

different sanctions lists and executive
orders the institution or organization is
subject to. Lists typically used globally by
several of countries, include OFAC SDN lists
of the US, Canadian sanctions lists (OSFI),
the UK Her Majesty’s Treasury list, and the
UN global sanctions lists. In addition, each
list has its own nuances and some laws and
executive orders of different nations apply to
every individual and organization associated
with certain countries.

•  Establishing a sanctions risk assessment to
determine which areas of the organization
are more vulnerable. Risk mitigation controls
can help reduce exposure to sanctions
violations and better focus the overall
sanctions compliance program, resulting in
proper attention, coverage and allocation
of resources.

•  Leveraging the combination of technology
and procedures to help prevent or detect
manipulation of payments information,
such as wire-stripping, where key details are
removed from a wire or message to avoid
sanctions requirements and accommodate
payments to or from sanctioned parties.

•  Development and delivery of training

programs to all pertinent employees and
key operational areas. This includes the
wire transfer departments in a financial
institution, to ensure that the employees
understand sanctions compliance
requirements. This can help them determine
if a transaction is permitted by law, and to
identify potential red flags and know the

mechanism for reporting suspicious or
unusual activity.

of nuclear weapons among hostile states, it is an
important component of sanctions compliance.

•  Implementation of a regular program
of testing and annual updates of the
risk assessment.

DUAL-USE GOODS AND
SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE
There  are  many  items  imported  and  exported
on  a  daily  basis  that  have  both  civil  and  mili-
tary  applications.  These  range  from  raw  mate-
rials such as metals and chemicals and machine
parts,  software  and  aviation  equipment  to  and
industrial and scientific tools. A centrifuge is one
possible example. It could be used for legitimate
research, but a rogue state may also seek to use it
as part of a program to develop nuclear weapons.

These  items  are  referred  to  as  “dual-use  goods,”
and are sometimes subject to export limitations
or  prohibition  under  sanctions  regimes.  The  US,
European  Union  and  other  countries  have  regu-
lations  in  place  restricting  trade  in  certain  dual-
use goods, for example, those involved in the pro-
duction  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  These
nations typically publish lists of restricted goods
and guidance related to their trade.

Businesses  who  produce,  sell  or  trade  in  dual-
use  goods  need  to  be  aware  of  the  restrictions
placed on them, including consulting the lists of
restricted goods and guidelines, and applying for
licenses to trade in these goods from the appro-
priate authorities if necessary.

Financial  institutions  involved  in  trade  finance
should  also  consider  their  policies  and  proce-
dures around reviewing letters of credit and other
transactions for the presence of dual-use goods.
One  step  could  involve  screening  trade  docu-
ments  and  the  parties  in  transactions  against
export control lists issued by the US, EU and oth-
ers.  Identifying  dual-use  goods  is  no  easy  task,
but  with  concern  growing  on  the  proliferation

IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING
UNUSUAL OR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY

INTERNAL DETECTION METHODS
A suspicious activity reporting (SAR) policy in an
organization should require all employees to sub-
mit an “unusual activity referral” when they iden-
tify unusual activity potentially related to corrup-
tion, fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing
or  other  illegal  activities.  It  is  important  that
employees  refer  activity  they  have  been  trained
to  recognize  as  merely  unusual,  rather  than
outright  suspicious.  The  financial  crime  investi-
gations  or  compliance  group  in  an  organization
investigates  and  makes  the  final  determination
about whether the unusual activity is suspicious
and  if  a  report  must  be  filed  to  the  appropriate
governmental authority.

EXTERNAL DETECTION METHODS
In  addition  to  reviewing  internal  customer  and
transactional  systems  for  potential  suspicious
activity,  the  investigations  group  of  an  organi-
zation  or  institution  should  be  responsible  for
reviewing  external  sources.  These  can  include
regulatory  and
law  enforcement  notices  or
requests, media reviews and other public sources.
Many  organizations  will  conduct  monitoring  of
so-called  “negative  news”  on  certain  customers,
especially those customers considered high- risk.
This can include setting up automatic news alerts
on  an  online  service,  such  as  Google  Alerts,  or
manually  searching  for  a  customer  or  entity  in
proprietary or public-access databases.

Many  jurisdictions  also  have  formal  or  informa-
tion arrangements under which financial institu-
tions and companies can share information with
each other. One example is the information-shar-
ing  sources  that  are  applicable  in  the  US  under
Sections 314(a) and (b) of the USA Patriot Act.

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

ANALYTICAL DETECTION
The  financial  crime  data  analytics  group  should
provide analytical detection tools and processes,
based on the customers, accounts, products, ser-
vices and transactions being conducted on behalf
of customers. The purpose is to identify unusual
activity and customers and third parties who may
present a money laundering, corruption, due dili-
gence or fraud risk.

THE EVOLVING
COMPLIANCE LANDSCAPE
Compliance  expectations  for  financial  institu-
tions  and  other  corporations  have  changed  dra-
matically in recent years, as statutory and regula-
tory expectations have evolved around the world.
There  are  four  essential  parts  of  an  effective
compliance management system:

•  A firm-wide approach to compliance risk

management and oversight

•  Independence of compliance staff

•  Compliance monitoring and testing

•  Assumption of oversight of the compliance
and risk management function by senior
management and the board of directors

It is important to note that a compliance testing
team  must  be  created  to  conduct  compliance
reviews  that  ensure  adherence  with  all  major
legal  and  internal  compliance  requirements  in
the  home  jurisdiction.  A  strong  compliance  pro-
gram should operate across the entire enterprise
to identify, measure and mitigate compliance risk.
Compliance  has  evolved  from  an  administrative
or  operational  cost  center,  typically  managed
through  the  institution’s  legal  or  audit  depart-
ment,  to  a  true  risk  management  discipline  in
many countries.

THE AML COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
Because  money  laundering  is  a  vital  component
of  all  financial  crime,  the  anti-money  launder-
ing  (AML)  compliance  program  is  a  critical  com-

ponent  of  an  organization’s  overall  compliance
regime. A solid AML compliance program helps to
protect  the  firm  against  being  used  for  corrup-
tion, fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing,
sanctions  violations  and  other  illegal  purposes.
It also helps to ensure that the organization is in
full  compliance  with  relevant  laws,  regulations
and international norms.

In  many  countries,  financial  institutions,  non-
bank financial services providers and other busi-
ness  organizations  must  establish  effective  AML
programs.  Financial  institutions  must  develop,
administer  and  maintain  an  effective  program
for  compliance  with  the  money  laundering  laws
and  regulations  in  the  countries  where  it  oper-
ates.  Worldwide,  a  consensus  has  emerged
that  there  are  the  following  “Four  Pillars”  of  a
sound program:

1.  A comprehensive written program

encompassing an effective AML internal
control structure. This includes the
institution’s policies, procedures and
processes designed to mitigate and control
risks associated with money laundering and
achieve compliance with relevant laws and
regulations.

2.  Independent testing conducted by the

internal audit department, outside auditors
or other qualified independent parties. The
testing should occur annually and should be
commensurate with the AML risk profile of
the organization.

3.  Designation of an AML compliance officer.

The organization’s board of directors
must designate an experienced, qualified
individual to serve as the AML compliance
officer to coordinate the program and
monitor day-to-day compliance.

4.  An ongoing employee training program. The
organization must ensure that appropriate
personnel, including senior management and
the board, are trained regularly in applicable
aspects of regulatory requirements as well as
internal policies, procedures and processes.

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

GLOBAL EXPECTATIONS FOR AML
COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS
Several  globally  recognized  organizations  have,
over  the  years,  established  expectations  and
norms  related  to  AML  compliance  which  have
become  accepted  standards  or  best  practices
in  many  countries.  These  recommended  proce-
dures and standards also apply in large measure
to  compliance  programs  beyond  AML,  such  as
global anticorruption and fraud.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Basel
Committee,  the  Wolfsberg  Group  and  the  Euro-
pean  Union  Directive  against  Money  Launder-
ing  provide  important  and  thorough  recom-
mendations.  These  recommendations  provide
governance  standards,  which  promote  effective
implementation  of  legal,  regulatory  and  opera-
tional measures for combating money laundering
and  other  financial  crime  threats  to  the  integ-
rity  of  the  organization  and  the  international
financial system.

Every  financial  institution,  non-bank  financial
services  entity  or  other  business  provider  faces
great  AML  compliance  challenges.  These  chal-
lenges include increased costs and protection of
the  organization  from  abuse,  including  protect-
ing the integrity of the financial system and the
economies of the countries in which they operate.

They  must  achieve  compliance  while  operating
in a competitive environment and trying to meet
their targets for revenue, operating margins and
return on assets. Thus, organizations are pushed
to “do more with less” to endeavor to keep com-
pliance  costs  as  low  as  possible,  while  ensuring
that  compliance  needs  are  met.  Unfortunately,
in  some  organizations,  the  commercial  business
side  of  the  staff  often  prevails  over  the  compli-
ance side and engages in business or transactions
that are either non-compliant or illegal. This can
result  in  significant  adverse  consequences,  pub-
licity, fines, forfeiture and prosecutions.

OVERVIEW OF THE RISK-
BASED APPROACH
The  FATF  and  numerous  member  countries,  as
well as the Basel Committee and Wolfsberg Group,
recommend  risk-based  controls.  No  financial
institution  or  other  business  organization  can
reasonably be expected to detect all money laun-
dering or other financial crime and illicit activities.
However, the universal consensus is that without
the ability to detect and control all such criminal
activity  a  risk-based  approach  is  recommended.
It  relies  on  levels  of  due  diligence  and  identifi-
able risk metrics and provides the most effective
levels of compliance and ability to detect, report
and prevent corruption, money laundering, fraud,
sanctions violations and terrorist financing.

The  key  elements  of  a  risk  assessment  program
include the following:

•  Methodology to quantify the level of the risk

and the adequacy of the controls

•  An assessment of the risk associated with

each line of business

•  An enterprise-wide assessment to identify
systemic risk that is not apparent in a line
of business or unit-focused risk assessment,
such as in the case of financial institutions
and the risk associated with foreign
correspondent banking, remote deposit
capture, private banking, mobile banking
and other high-risk products, services
and customers

Risk  scoring  models  generally  use  a  weighted
numerical  ranking  of  risk  and  look  primarily  at
the  “triad”  of  customer,  product/service  and
geography.  Risk  models  should  also  take  into
account the line of business because certain lines,
such  as  private  banking  or  correspondent  ban-
king  and  financial  institutions,  for  example,  are
considered  more  vulnerable  to  financial  crime,
including money laundering.

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

HIGH-RISK CUSTOMERS
Although  any  type  of  account  is  potentially  vul-
nerable  to  fraud,  corruption,  money  launder-
ing or other illegal activity by the nature of their
business,  occupation  or  anticipated  transaction
activity, certain customers and entities may pose
specific  risks.  In  assessing  customer  risk,  finan-
cial  institutions  should  consider  other  variables,
such as services sought and geographic locations.
The following are types of customers that present
greater potential AML risk:

•  Foreign financial institutions, including banks
and foreign money services providers, such
as Casas de Cambio, currency exchanges and
money transmitters to name a few examples

•  Nonbank financial institutions, such as

money services businesses, casinos, brokers
and dealers in securities, and dealers in
precious metals, stones or jewels

•  Senior foreign political figures, their
immediate family members and close
associates, who are collectively known as
politically exposed persons (PEP)

•  Nonresident aliens (NRA) and accounts of

foreign individuals

•  Foreign corporations and domestic business
entities, particularly offshore corporations,
such as domestic shell companies,
Private Investment Companies (PICs) and
international business corporations (IBCs),
located in higher-risk geographic locations

•  Deposit brokers, particularly those based in

other countries

•  Cash-intensive businesses, such as

convenience stores, restaurants, retail stores,
liquor stores, cigarette distributors, privately
owned ATMs, vending machine operators and
parking garages

•  Foreign and domestic nongovernmental

organizations and charities

•  Professional service providers and so-called
gatekeepers, such as attorneys, accountants,

notaries and even real estate brokers and
intermediaries.

HIGH-RISK PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Certain  products  and  services  offered  by  finan-
cial institutions, non-bank financial services and
other  business  organizations  may  pose  a  higher
risk  of  financial  crime,  including  money  laun-
dering  or  terrorist  financing,  depending  on  the
nature  of  the  product  or  service  offered.  Such
products  and  services  may  facilitate  a  higher
degree  of  anonymity  or  involve  the  handling  of
high  volumes  of  currency  or  currency  equiva-
lents.  These  products  and  services  include  but
are certainly not limited to the following:

Electronic  funds  payment  services,  including
electronic cash, prepaid and payroll cards, domes-
tic  and  international  funds  transfers,  “payable
upon proper identification” (PUPID) transactions,
third-party  payment  processors,  money  remit-
tances, automated clearing house (ACH) transac-
tions and automated teller machines (ATM):

•  Electronic banking

•  Private banking (domestic and international)

•  Trust and asset management services

•  Monetary instruments

•  Foreign correspondent accounts, such as

bulk shipments of currency, pouch activity
and payable through accounts (PTA)

•  Trade finance

•  Services provided to third party payment

processors or senders

•  Foreign exchange

•  Special use or concentration accounts

HIGH-RISK JURISDICTIONS AND
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
Identifying  geographic  locations  that  may  pose
a  higher  risk  is  essential  to  the  compliance  pro-
gram  of  an  organization,  especially  to  control
corruption, money laundering and sanctions vio-
lations.  Financial  institutions  should  understand
and  evaluate  the  specific  risks  associated  with
doing  business  in,  opening  accounts  for  custom-
ers  from,  or  facilitating  transactions  involving
certain geographic locations.

Certain countries, jurisdictions and regions pose
a  greater  threat  of  money  laundering,  terror-
ist  financing,  bribery  and  corruption,  and  fraud.
The organization should establish a documented
geography  risk  rating  methodology  that  lever-
ages  internal  and  external  information  sources,
including these:

•  Sanctions and terrorist financing lists

published by governments and international
organizations can be helpful in assessing
financial crime and money laundering risks.
These include lists published by the US
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the
UK Financial Services Authority, the United
Nations Security Council Committee, the
US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN) and the European Union.

•  The overall reputation of a country should

be factored into the risk model. For example,
certain countries or jurisdictions have high
levels of corruption or unstable governments.
Some are known as bank secrecy and
money laundering havens or suffer from
high levels of drug production and shipping
and cartel activities. Information sources
to help identify reputational risk include
Transparency International’s “Corruption
Perceptions Index” and the US State
Department’s annual International Narcotics
Control Strategy Report (INCSR), which rates
countries based on their money laundering
controls and corruption. Most of these are

available on the websites of the appropriate
organization.

•  The risk model may take into account

whether a country is a member of FATF
or of a FATF-style regional body, and has
implemented practices commensurate with
international standards promulgated by the
FATF and other international organizations.

•  The risk model should also take into account
regional risk inside a particular country,
such as the cross-border areas between
nations, or designated areas of high intensity
financial crime or drug trafficking, such as
the US High Intensity Financial Crime Areas
(HIFCA) or High Intensity Drug Trafficking
Areas (HIDTA).

EVOLVING RISK ASSESSMENT
EXPECTATIONS
The  overall  AML  and  sanctions  risk  assessment
can  serve  as  an  effective  tool  and  solid  basis
for  overall  financial  crime  compliance  program
design.  However,  some  challenges  or  potential
risks  do  not  fit  neatly  into  a  product,  customer
or geography category but should be considered
in  the  design  of  controls  and  evaluation  across
multiple  risk  areas.  There  should  be  a  clear  link
between  the  organization’s  risk  assessment  and
program design.

These  days,  regulatory  examiners  place  more
emphasis on assessing the adequacy of a financial
institution’s  efforts  to  ensure  ongoing  effective-
ness and integrity of their compliance programs.
For  example,  in  the  US,  the  Office  of  the  Comp-
troller  of  the  Currency  (OCC),  the  key  regulator
of national banks and thrifts, has been prompting
institutions to include their AML compliance pro-
grams  and  controls  into  their  overall  risk  model
validation. Part of this validation includes assess-
ing the systems, processes and procedures used
within business lines, as well as for compliance.

Financial  institutions,  corporations  and  orga-
nizations  must  look  to  their  service  technology

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

224

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

and identify the account or service technologies
that  are  right  for  their  business  model  and  how
financial  crime,  money  laundering  or  terrorist
financing  risks  might  vary  by  this  technology.
They must define and identify vulnerabilities and
develop  a  clear  roadmap  on  how  those  vulnera-
bilities  are  assessed  and  addressed.  This  should
be  a  cross-institutional  effort  undertaken  with
support  across  business  lines  throughout  the
organization.

When  attempting  to  address  vulnerabilities,  the
organization should focus on the following:

•  Vulnerability assessments that identify
weaknesses in systems or controls and
the features of unique financial products
or services which may make them open to
abuse or exploitation for money laundering or
terrorist financing. Vulnerability assessments
primarily focus on weaknesses that could
allow for financial crime, including money
laundering or terrorist financing.

•  Potential threat recognition identifies

potential threats presented by the nature of
the organization’s business, customers, and
the geographies in which it operates. The
combination of an external threat coupled
with internal vulnerability often results in
occurrences of financial crime, including
corruption, fraud, money laundering or
terrorist financing.

As  the  organization  conducts  its  assessment,  it
should  determine  whether  the  assessment  mea-
sures are retrospective or prospective in nature.
Retrospective  analysis  will  provide  learning  and
insights  by  drawing  on  data  from  past  events  in
order to fine-tune any present vulnerability. Con-
ducting prospective analysis is equally important.
A prospective analysis is a process of attempting
to look into the future with the benefit of histor-
ical data to help better identify emerging vulner-
abilities or threats.

Implementing continuous system risk assessment
and model risk validation programs helps ensure
the financial institution or organization is proac-
tively  addressing  areas  of  internal,  statutory  or
regulatory  focus.  This  helps  them  stay  in  com-
pliance, facilitates the examination process, con-
tributes  to  operational  efficiencies  and  ensures
the reputational integrity of the organization.

CUSTOMER ONBOARDING
AND MONITORING
Customer  onboarding  is  the  process  of  opening
a  new  account  or  accounts,  providing  certain
products  and  services,  and  beginning  to  build  a
relationship with the customer. In the context of
AML  compliance,  customer  onboarding  involves
due  diligence  on  new  customers.  Monitoring  of
the customer means regular reassessment of the
risk or potential risk, presented by the customer
based  on  the  customer’s  activities  at  the  institu-
tion  or  organization.  Establishing  and  following
proper  onboarding  and  monitoring  policies  and
procedures  are  key  parts  of  developing  the  cus-
tomer  relationship,  and  help  protect  the  institu-
tion against financial crime, including corruption,
money laundering, terrorist financing and fraud.

KEY ELEMENTS OF A “KNOW YOUR
CUSTOMER” PROGRAM
A sound Know Your Customer and Customer Due
Diligence  (KYC/CDD)  program  includes  robust
identification  and  account-opening
customer
customer  initiation  procedures  that  allow  the
institution or organization to determine the true
identity  of  each  customer  and  assess  the  risk  or
potential  risk  presented  by  the  customer.  The
major components of KYC include account open-
ing,  the  customer  identification  program  (CIP)
and  ongoing  monitoring.  KYC  can  also  include
“Enhanced  Due  Diligence”  (EDD)  for  customers
that pose a higher risk based on attributes deter-
mined at the opening of the account or the cus-
tomer activities after the account is opened.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

Common  account  opening  procedures  and  best
practices include:

•  Gathering and verifying customer

identification materials through paper
documents and/or electronic identity
verification

•  Clarifying and stating the services that are

available to the customer

•  Having all forms available and understanding

them sufficiently well to explain them
professionally to the customer

•  Verifying and authenticating the

customer’s identity

•  Screening the customer against sanctions
lists, watch lists and politically exposed
persons (PEP) lists

•  Documenting the normal and expected
activity of each customer, including
occupation and business operations

•  Documenting the customer’s relationship

with the institution or organization, including
all lines of business within the organization
and its subsidiaries that the customer
will utilize

CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION
PROGRAM (CIP)
Regulated  entities  in  the  banking  and  securi-
ties industries in many countries are required to
implement  a  “customer  identification  program,”
or CIP, as it is called in the US. A CIP must include
risk-based procedures for the verification of the
identity of each customer to the extent reasonable
and practical. Essential identification information

must be collected at the time the customer seeks
to open an account and must be verified within a
reasonable time after the account is established.

In addition, financial institutions must verify the
identity of customers prior to undertaking large
currency  transactions,  purchasing  certain  finan-
cial instruments or ordering wire transfers. This
includes  vetting  the  customers  against  relevant
sanctions or other watch lists.

Under  current  rules  and  regulations  in  many
countries, CIP regulations do not require a finan-
cial  institution  or  other  organization  to  authen-
ticate  the  identity  of  the  beneficial  owners  of
proposed accounts in all cases. However, an orga-
nization  is  obliged  to  look  through  a  non-  indi-
vidual  customer  particularly  business  organiza-
tions  to  attempt  to  identify  the  individuals  with
authority or control over the account. This is cru-
cial  when  the  institution  or  other  organization
cannot  verify  the  customer’s  true  identity  after
using standard verification methods.

Typically,  the  institution  does  not  have  to  com-
plete  unanimous  verification  of  all  identifying
information.  But  it  must  achieve  a  level  of  con-
fidence through a plurality of defined metrics or
indicators, assumed to be sufficient, to establish
and verify the customer’s information.

CUSTOMER MONITORING
Financial institutions are often required by regu-
lation to apply ongoing monitoring to certain cor-
respondent and private banking accounts, as well
as to the accounts of customers who pose higher
risk or potentially higher risk. This is determined

by information collected at the time of onboard-
ing, specific customer activity, and other material
factors that may have changed since onboarding.

The  institution  should  collect  customer  due  dil-
igence  information  in  a  database  or  system  that
is  accessible  to  relationship  managers  and  com-
pliance  personnel.  Designated  personnel  should
periodically  update  these  customer  records  to
reflect  changes  in  behavior,  activity  profile,  or
other  factors  that  impact  the  AML  and  other
financial crime risk posed by the customer. This
new information should be factored into a re-as-
sessment of customer risk along with supporting
factors, such as transactional activity, geographic
exposure and suspicious activity history.

ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE (EDD) FOR
HIGH-RISK SERVICES, CUSTOMERS, AND
JURISDICTIONS
Customer  due  diligence  requirements  have
increased  in  recent  years  in  keeping  with  evolv-
ing  regulatory  expectations  for  a  more  effective
and  ongoing  monitoring  of  existing  customers.
Customer  and  third  party  due  diligence  is  the
cornerstone of a strong compliance program and
requires that institutions and other organizations
conduct and record specialized or enhanced due
diligence (EDD) for high-risk customers.

The information gathered in CIP, customer ques-
tionnaires,  and  results  of  screening  will  provide
the raw material for risk assessment and rating.

The  risk  score  will  guide  the  level  of  additional
due  diligence  required,  if  any.  For  customers  at
the lowest risk of involvement in financial crime,
institutions may choose to conduct simplified due
diligence,  or  the  minimum  level  required  under
the  jurisdiction’s  AML  regulations.  Institutions
may  allow  relationship  managers  or  lower  levels
of  staff  to  approve  customers  subject  to  simpli-
fied due diligence. Publicly traded companies and
pension funds are common examples of low-risk
customer types.

Customers at higher risk tiers will require further
measures, or enhanced due diligence, to manage
their  financial  crime  risk.  Some  common  EDD
techniques include:

•  Additional investigation into a customer’s

source of funds or wealth. Institutions could
request additional records and information
from customers, such as financial documents
for a company or copies of tax returns for
individuals, or conduct their own research

•  Identifying and verifying beneficial owners

down to a lower ownership threshold

•  Additional verification of customer-supplied

information, using multiple sources

•  Thresholds on the size or frequency of
transactions a customer can conduct

•  Approval by progressively higher levels
of management based on the risk of
the customer

In  some  cases,  institutions  may  determine  that
a customer poses an undue risk, and decline the
relationship  or  transaction.  Institutions  should
have policies in place for when and how to man-
age  the  termination  of  a  customer  relationship,
including what records to keep and when to file
suspicious transaction reports.

Management should establish periodic reviews of
higher risk customers to determine if their activ-
ity is reasonable, that customer due diligence and
enhanced  due  diligence  procedures  are  com-
pleted,  and  the  customer  risk  rating  is  accurate
and up-to-date.

EMPLOYEE ONBOARDING
AND MONITORING
Similar  to  customer  onboarding  and  monitor-
ing,  employee  onboarding  and  monitoring  plays
a critical role in financial crime prevention at all
business  organizations,  including  financial  insti-
tutions.  An  insider  can  pose  the  same  money
laundering threat as a customer. Establishing and

following  proper  employee  onboarding  policies
and  procedures  help  protect  the  organization
against  potential  employee  involvement  or  collu-
sion in all financial crime and protects the integ-
rity and sanctity of internal processes and infor-
mation from filtration to outside elements.

KEY ELEMENTS OF “KNOW YOUR
EMPLOYEE” PROGRAMS
A  Know  Your  Employee  (KYE)  program  allows
the  organization  to  understand  an  employee’s
background,  associations,  conflicts  of  interest
and  susceptibility  to  corruption,  money  launder-
ing, tax evasion or fraudulent activities. When an
employee is hired, part of the orientation process
should include a proper introduction to the com-
pany culture and the expectations the employee
is  supposed  to  meet  in  that  culture.  This  orien-

tation  should  include  rules,  regulations,  respon-
sibilities  and  the  organization’s  code  of  ethics.
Senior management must set the tone or culture
at  and  from  the  top,  consistently  and  regularly
communicate  the  organization’s  ethical  policies
and  code  of  conduct  as  well  as  emphasize  the
important  role  each  employee  plays  in  ensuring
that these policies are adhered to and honored.

Best  practices  that  have  evolved  for  effective
employee onboarding include the following:

•  Onboarding and assessment, which begins
during the interview process. The vetting
should include background screening,
especially for criminal history. It is important
to conduct a complete review of the

employee before hiring, including checking
references and relevant background checks.

software, so-called exception reports, log
files, and the like.

•  Gathering and verifying employee

identification materials through paper
documents and electronic identity
verification

•  Screening the employee against sanctions
lists, watch lists and politically exposed
persons (PEP) lists

•  Regular reviews and updates on the

company’s ethics policies and ethical
compliance culture

•  Regular communication that enforces

the organization’s policies, including full
disclosure if financial crime has occurred
and the actions that were taken

•  Providing new employees with a copy of

•  Ongoing employee training in recognizing

the organization’s written ethics policy and
code of conduct

•  Providing appropriate training for the

position the employee is hired for, including
written regulations and web-based or
classroom training on financial crime
addressing corruption, money laundering,
fraud and sanctions with scenarios that are
appropriate to the business and the clientele
with which the employee will be working

•  The institution of a “hotline” that employees
may use to anonymously report financial
crime tips covering a range of financial
crimes on which they should be trained

Proper  employee  onboarding
improves  pro-
ductivity  and  contribution  by  ensuring  that  the
employee fully understands his or her job respon-
sibilities and has access to necessary tools.

EMPLOYEE MONITORING
Best practices for effective employee monitoring
can include the following:

•  Regularly scheduled background screening
especially of criminal history to identify
employees who should be removed

•  Ongoing monitoring of employee actions and
activities as they pertain to their facilitation
of account or transactional activity for
customers. This can be achieved through
a combination of automated monitoring

red flags for corruption, tax evasion, money
laundering, fraud and other financial crime,
as well as clear guidelines on how to follow
up and report on financial crime suspicions

When  an  employee  is  supported  by  an  ethical
company culture, he or she is constantly reminded
to perform the required customer due diligence
and to pay attention to how customers and third
parties  establish  relationships  with  employees.
One example is where a customer is grooming an
employee  for  a  future  financial  crime  or  money
laundering  transaction,  or  collusion  in  a  related
scheme where the employee does not merely rub-
ber-  stamp  questionable  transactions,  and  does
not accept corrupt or improper compensation.

RED FLAGS OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION
IN FINANCIAL CRIME
Employee perpetration of or collusion in financial
crime,  including  corruption,  tax  evasion  money
laundering,  sanctions  violations  and  fraud  can
occur  in  financial  and  non-financial  organiza-
tions. Employees in financial institutions or other
financial  services  providers  may  have  access  to
customer  and  account  data  and  the  ability  to
move funds in and out of accounts. Employees in
other  organizations  may  have  access  to  account
information through statements or online access
and  financial  instruments,  such  as  checks  or
electronic  access  to  payment  mechanisms.  This
access  highlights  the  vulnerability  to  insider
financial  crime,  including  fraud,  and  the  impor-
tance  of  ongoing  monitoring  of  employee  activ-

ity  and  lifestyle  factors  when  they  are  available
to help detect and prevent financial crime by the
“enemy within.”

Although  not  an  exhaustive  list,  the  following
are red flags or indicators of potential employee
involvement in financial crime of a wide variety:

•  Employee approves or is involved in an

inordinate number of exceptions to policies,
procedures, account limits and other rules of
the organization

•  Employee frequently overrides or

circumvents internal controls, approval
authority or established policies, including
accessing accounts and records for which
the employee has no legitimate business
purpose to access

•  Employee misrepresents the identity,
background, associations or financial
resources of a customer at the time
of onboarding, updating customer
documentation or due diligence

•  Employee is involved in completing or

expediting financial or business transactions
where the identity of the counter party or
ultimate beneficiary is not identified
Employee accounts or other accounts linked
to the employee, such as those opened in

the names of family members and associates,
show unusual levels of activity, such as
internal transfers into the accounts followed
by wires or other transactions out of
the accounts

•  Employee never takes a vacation, or takes

much less than the minimum vacation period
that is mandated by the organization

•  Employee resists an internal transfer to

another unit or element of the organization

•  Employee enjoys a lavish lifestyle, including

high-end cars, real estate and lavish trips, for
example, which cannot be supported by his
or her normal compensation

INVESTIGATING AND IDENTIFYING
BENEFICIAL OWNERS
As  previously  mentioned  in  the  Money  Laun-
dering  chapter,  the  term  “beneficial  ownership,”
when  used  to  refer  to  beneficial  ownership  of  a
financial  account,  is  conventionally  understood
to  refer  to  the  person  who  maintains  ultimate
control over funds in an account through owner-
ship or other means. “Control” in this sense is dis-
tinguished from mere signature authority or legal
title. The specific definition of a beneficial owner
of a legal entity includes an individual who owns
or controls, directly or indirectly, greater than a
certain percentage of the legal entity.

Beneficial ownership recognizes that a person in
whose  name  an  account  is  opened  with  a  finan-
cial  services  provider  or  other  organization  is
not  necessarily  the  person  who  ultimately  con-
trols  these  funds.  This  distinction  is  important
because  the  focus  of  financial  crime  and  AML
efforts should be on the person who has this ulti-
mate level of control. Placing the emphasis on this
person is typically a necessary step in determin-
ing  the  source  of  wealth.  The  beneficial  owner
concept plays an important but understated role
in  the  global  crackdown  on  corruption,  fraud,
money laundering and tax evasion.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

230

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

Determining  beneficial  ownership  has  become
increasingly  important  from  a  regulatory  stand-
point  internationally  and  in  many  nations.  The
Financial  Action  Task  Force  now  emphasizes  it
in  its  recommendations  and  interpretive  notes.
Beneficial ownership involves establishing mech-
anisms  to  record  basic  information  about  the
organization  or  individual  to  enable  financial
institutions, the pertinent authorities and others
to determine the true ownership. This is needed
to  conduct  appropriate  due  diligence  on  the
real customer.

Many  countries  and  the  FATF  have  progres-
sively  raised  expectations  regarding  beneficial
ownership  rules.  For  example,  the  US  Finan-
cial  Crimes  Enforcement  Network,  which  is  that
nation’s  Financial  Intelligence  Unit,  has  officially
announced that it may require the institutions it
regulates to determine the names of individuals
who directly or indirectly own more than 25 per-
cent of a legal entity that has a relationship with
the financial institution.

Beneficial  ownership  has  also  been  a  central
focus of the FATF’s mutual evaluation process as
to the adequacy of controls that exist in various
nations. This focus is part of a larger strategy to
improve  the  availability  of  beneficial  ownership
information for legal entities that open accounts
or  conduct  transactions  through  financial  insti-
tutions  and  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of
global  standards  for  obtaining  beneficial  own-
ership  information  by  financial  institutions  and
other business organizations.

DETECTING AND REPORTING
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
Financial  institutions  in  most  countries,  includ-
ing  non-bank  financial  services  providers,  are
required to monitor customer and entity behavior
to detect transactions or activity which could be
indicative of money laundering or other financial
crime activity. This includes corruption, tax eva-
sion, fraud and terrorist financing.

There are no firm rules on what constitutes sus-
picious activity. However, there are known typol-
ogies  of  transactions  and  other  activities  that
serve  as  common  indicators  of  financial  crime,
including money laundering. In addition, activity
that  is  not  consistent  with  a  customer’s  known
style  of  living,  source  of  income  or  wealth,  type
of business, or type of accounts or services used
should be scrutinized.

Because  most  organizations  must  monitor  and
attempt to flag thousands and maybe millions of
transactions each day, they should employ a risk-
based approach determined by elements such as
their  business  profile,  location,  types  of  prod-
ucts  and  services  offered,  third-party  relation-
ships and geography. When suspicious or unusual
activity  is  detected,  organizations  must  investi-
gate  to  determine  if  there  is  a  reasonable  expla-
nation for the activity, or if there is a likelihood of
financial crime in the broad sense.

If financial crime, including money laundering, is
suspected,  or  if  the  activity  cannot  be  reason-
ably  explained,  the  organization  is  likely  obliged
to report the activity through a suspicious activ-
ity  report  or  suspicious  transaction  report.  This
depends  on  the  requirements  of  the  country  in
which  it  operates.  Each  country’s  laws  and  reg-
ulations  dictate  the  length  of  time  the  organi-
zation  has  to  report  the  suspicious  activity,  the
frequency  of  additional  reporting  if  the  activity
continues,  and  the  length  of  time  it  must  main-
tain these records.

It should be noted that suspicious activity report-
ing  often  takes  place  in  two  contexts:  reporting
within an organization or institution, or reporting
to external government agencies and regulators.

In the case of reporting to government agencies,
many jurisdictions have specific reporting forms
they must complete and file with a regulatory or
enforcement agency. In Canada, for example, the
forms for  financial institutions are  called  “Suspi-
cious  Transaction  Reports  (STRs)”  and  are  filed

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

231

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

with FINTRAC, that nation’s governmental finan-
cial intelligence unit, or FIU. In the US, the forms
are  called  “Suspicious  Activity  Reports  (SARs)”
and  are  filed  with  the  Financial  Crimes  Enforce-
ment Network. In most jurisdictions, reports are
filed with the governmental FIU, which then has
the responsibility of analyzing and disseminating
them to law enforcement.

Most  jurisdictions  have  clearly  prescribed  pro-
cedures for filing suspicious transaction reports,
along  with  standard  forms  or  electronic  filing
systems  that  institutions  use.  These  forms  typi-
cally contain several sections:

•  Contact information for the filing institution

•  Information on the institution where

suspicious activity occurred

•  Information on the subject(s) involved
in the suspicious activity, including
personal information, account and
transactional details

•  Fields to select the type(s) of suspicious

activity being reported

•  A narrative portion, in which the filer can
describe the activity and provide further
supporting details

Training  on  effective  suspicious  transaction
reporting is a critically important part of an insti-
tution’s  overall  compliance  training  program.
STRs/SARs are the main mechanism the financial
sector  uses  to  provide  intelligence  on  potential
financial crime to law enforcement.

In  some  cases,  high-quality  reports  provided  by
a  well-trained  compliance  staffer  can  literally
make or break an investigation. A form’s narrative
section  can  be  particularly  useful  in  this  regard,
allowing an institution to provide insights on the
transactions  and  supporting  intelligence  that
otherwise would not be available in the standard
form fields.

Along with training, other general best practices
for a reporting program include:

•  Processes to identify suspicious activity
through multiple channels, including
alerts produced by transaction monitoring
systems, referrals or notifications from
employees, and requests or queries from law
enforcement and regulators.

•  Investigation and review processes for each

suspicious activity identified.

•  Decision-making procedures for when to
file a report, when to escalate the decision
and when to decline, supported by thorough
documentation.

•  Periodic briefings to senior management
that can include metrics on suspicious
activity reporting, amounts involved, notable
trends and any issues requiring immediate
attention. In some jurisdictions, this periodic
reporting is a regulatory requirement.

•  Ongoing review, quality assurance
and oversight of STR/SAR filing
program – Ongoing oversight can include
several elements:

 » Periodic evaluations of actual reports filed

for quality and completeness

 » Reviews of the decision-making process and

accompanying documentation

 » Procedures for oversight of the employees

responsible for filing reports

Additionally, many institutions and organizations
will  have  some  system  of  internal  reporting  of
suspicious activity. One example could be slightly
uncharacteristic  or  irregular  transactions  in  a
business  account  that,  while  they  do  not  rise
to  the  level  of  a  governmental  suspicious  activ-
ity  report,  may  still  warrant  monitoring  and  fol-
low-up. An institution employee may file a report
with  their  internal  FIU  to  flag  the  account  for
further review.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

The  information  provided  in  suspicious  activity
reports  to  governmental  FIUs  is  a  key  resource
for law enforcement investigations in many juris-
dictions.  Information  from  suspicious  activity
reports can help enforcement agencies find infor-
mation  on  individual  accounts  or  persons  they
are investigating, or alert them to new potential
criminal activity in progress.

Suspicious activity reporting can also be used by
institutions or law enforcement to get a high-level
view of financial crime in a given area or jurisdic-
tion.  Governmental  FIUs  can  analyze  all  reports
involving mortgage fraud, for example, and place
that information on a map to gain a better under-
standing of where such fraud is happening most
frequently. Internal FIUs can conduct similar ana-
lytics. This ability to capture large-scale financial
crime  trends  can  help  institutions  and  govern-
ments allocate resources more effectively.

OVERVIEW OF AML COMPLIANCE
MONITORING SYSTEMS
Because  of  evolving  regulatory  expectations,  as
well  as  the  volume  of  customers,  transactions
and data involved in monitoring and surveillance,
many organizations leverage specialized technol-
ogy  to  help  meet  their  detection  and  reporting
requirements.  The  major  types  of  information
technology systems or solutions used in financial
crime in general, particularly AML and sanctions
compliance, include the following:

Transaction monitoring systems. An automated
system,  either  a  proprietary  application  or  ven-
dor-provided  solution,  for  ongoing  scanning  of
transaction,  customer  and  entity  data.  The  solu-
tion filters, compiles and summarizes transaction
data  and  flags  or  alerts  on  instances  of  poten-
tially  suspicious  behavior.  Detection  is  typically
accomplished  through  implementation  of  AML
scenarios that fall into two broad categories:

•  Rules-based scenarios that identify specific

patterns of behavior related to known

financial crime and money laundering
typologies or red flags

•  Statistical profiling scenarios that identify
unusual activity by modeling typical or
expected activity profiles for a specific
customer or type of customer and
identifying outliers

Some software leverages both approaches to help
ensure the best possible detection capabilities. In
addition,  most  transaction  monitoring  systems
also provide alert and investigations management
systems  to  facilitate  and  document  the  analysis
and investigation of alerts and cases.

Cases  are  reviewed  by  financial  crime  analysts,
including those devoted to AML, who investigate
the activity along with supporting data and infor-
mation. The analyst then determines whether to
clear the case or escalate it for further review and
action, including suspicious activity reporting in
the appropriate jurisdiction.

Like  any  other  element  of  the  compliance  pro-
gram,  transaction  monitoring  solutions  require
ongoing  quality  assurance  and  review  to  func-
tion effectively. This includes refining monitoring
rules, statistical models, and the data feeding into
monitoring systems to address two types of prob-
lematic issues: False positives and false negatives.

•  False positives are transactions or

patterns that are not actually suspicious,
but incorrectly flagged as suspicious by
monitoring system

•  False negatives are transactions or patterns
that are actually suspicious or indicative
of financial crime that are NOT flagged by
transaction monitoring system

False positives tend to receive the most attention
from  compliance  staff,  for  understandable  rea-
sons.  A  false  positive  is  visible  and  apparent  to
analysts, and dealing with large numbers of them
can waste considerable time and resources. False

CHAPTER 11 • COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS

It should be noted that false negatives can crop up
in  any  system  used  to  monitor  accounts,  includ-
ing  sanctions  screening  tools,  negative  news
sweeps, and others.

Sanctions  and  watch  list  filtering  software.  An
automated  system,  either  proprietary  or  pro-
vided by a vendor, for filtering of customers and
entities that are present in sanctions lists or other
types  of  internal  or  external  risk-based  watch
lists.  Scanning  of  accounts  against  sanctions
and  watch  lists  is  performed  at  the  time  of  new
account  opening  and  during  periodic  customer
database scans. Transaction reviews (often called
transaction  filtering)  against  sanctions  lists  are
performed  as  transactions  and  are  initiated  or
received  using  either  a  batch  or  real-time  pro-
cess.  Transactions  involving  sanctioned  entities
are blocked.

Know your customer and customer due diligence
modules.  Increasingly,  transaction  monitoring
solutions  provide  modules  that  support  ongoing
monitoring  and  due  diligence  of  customers  and
accounts.  These  systems  typically  leverage  cus-
tomer  data  obtained  at  account  opening  as  well
as  alerts  or  exceptions  detected  through  ongo-
ing monitoring. They also facilitate the recording
and  updating  of  customer  information  and  risk
assessments.

Internal  reports.  Internally  generated  reports
or  systems,  such  as  large  transaction  reports,
third-party  activity,  incident  reports,  leads  data-
base and others, which flag activities and provide
important  ancillary  information  that  is  used  to
analyze or investigate alerts or cases.

Third-party  data.  Reports,  online  research
portals,  and  public  record  or  proprietary  data
sources and analytics that are provided by third
party  data  vendors  and  repositories.  This  infor-
mation  is  used  at  account  opening  for  upfront
“know  your  customer  and  customer  informa-
tion  program”  purposes,  as  well  as  to  support

negatives  are  far  less  obvious,  since  by  defini-
tion  they  trigger  no  alerts  and  are  typically  not
detected  until  well  after  the  fact,  through  peri-
odic audits, reviews triggered by suspicious activ-
ity  in  an  account,  or  even  regulatory  enforce-
ment actions.

There  are  several  issues  that  can  lead  to  false
negatives. In some instances, they are a result of
sheer user error – Staff are not trained properly,
or  are  not  using  the  transaction  monitoring  sys-
tem  in  the  way  it  was  designed.  In  other  cases,
the  system  is  not  operating  effectively  –  Rules
and  scenarios  are  incomplete  based  on  an  insti-
tution’s  financial  crime  risk,  or  not  being  prop-
erly applied.

In  still  other  cases,  false  negatives  result  from
data  issues.  Information  is  not  flowing  into  the
transaction  monitoring  system  properly  due  to
technical  issues,  or  an  institution  is  not  utiliz-
ing the full range of data it has at its disposal for
monitoring purposes.

 The goal of auditing a monitoring system should
be  to  reduce  both,  but  any  indication  that  mon-
itoring  is  leading  to  false  negatives  should  gen-
erally  be  given  priority.  The  existence  of  false
negatives  can  mean  that  a  monitoring  system  is
entirely missing activity that may be indicative of
financial crime.

alerts analysis and investigation of suspicious or
unusual activity.

Automation can play a key role in financial crime
control programs and should be part of an organi-
zation’s strategic planning process in information
technology. Ongoing maintenance and evolution
of these systems may be factored into the finan-
cial crime compliance program as a component.

This should include periodic validation of the sys-
tem  through  internal  audit,  regulatory  examina-
tion,  or  third  party  independent  evaluation  opti-
mizing the system through scenario and threshold
tuning,  and  improvements  to  data  quality  and
availability.  It  should  also  include  changes  made
to enable prompt response in evolving regulatory
requirements  or  new  financial  crime  typologies,
including those for money laundering and terror-
ist financing.

ONGOING TESTING AND DUE
DILIGENCE OF MONITORING AND
REPORTING PROCESSES
In  virtually  every  country,  examiners  conduct
periodic  examinations  of  AML  and  financial
crime  compliance  programs.  When  reviewing
compliance  monitoring  and  reporting  systems,
they usually focus on the adequacy of the system
and evaluate the reasonableness of the scenarios
and parameters applied, as well as changes to the
systems and policies.

Recently, they have begun to place more empha-
sis  on  assessing  the  adequacy  of  the  efforts  of
financial  institutions  and  other  organizations  to
ensure  ongoing  effectiveness  and  integrity.  In
many  countries,  regulators  have  been  signaling

increased  scrutiny  of  automated  systems  sup-
porting financial crime, AML and sanctions com-
pliance programs. Their recommendations often
focus  on  validation  of  monitoring  systems  to
assess the integrity of data inputs, the accuracy
of algorithms, the appropriateness of thresholds
and scenarios, and the structure of case manage-
ment, investigation and reporting.

Financial institutions must put in place a program
to consistently and regularly assess their compli-
ance systems’ performance and apply corrective
action  to  address  deficiencies.  Two  key  areas  of
evaluation should be included:

•  Effectiveness: the system’s ability to properly
identify and report suspicious activity and
help ensure compliance with regulations, as
well as reputational and legal integrity

•  Efficiency: the system’s ability to reduce
the number of false positive alerts or
exceptions while minimizing the risk
of “missing something.” Efficiency helps
reduce costs without increasing the risk of
non-compliance.

Implementing  a  continuous  system  and  perfor-
mance assessment program facilitates the exam-
ination  process,  proactively  addresses  areas  of
regulatory focus, and contributes to operational
efficiencies. A well-structured and rigorous com-
pliance program of periodic assessment coupled
with  independent  testing  can  provide  compli-
ance officers, senior management and the board
of directors with the information needed to keep
financial  crime  compliance  program  effective
and responsive.

CHAPTER 11 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

Q  11-1.  As  the  compliance  officer  in  a  national  financial  institution,  you  have  recently
received an alert from your regulator warning of suspected bulk cash smuggling into your
jurisdiction.

Which recent activity might be indicative of bulk cash smuggling?

A.  An increase in domestic wire transfers between another bank within your jurisdiction

and your financial institution

B. A significant number of cash withdrawals, all under $10,000, from your

financial institution

C. Large amounts of small denomination currency being sent from a Foreign Financial

Institution (FFI) to an account at your bank

D. A dramatic increase in domestic ACH transactions at your bank

See Answer and Rationales

Q  11-2.  A  US  bank  receives  a  letter  of  credit  from  an  issuing  bank  in  connection  with
the purchase of wheat from a bank customer. The buyer/applicant is located in Belarus, a
country in which certain senior government officials are on the US Specially Designated
National (SDN) List. The country is not, however, subject to comprehensive US sanctions.

The  buyer  is  determined  to  be  a  joint  venture  in  which  a  Belarus  SDN  has  a  50  percent
interest through two separate companies wholly owned by the SDN. Each has a 25 percent
interest in the joint venture. No funds have yet been received by the bank. Which state-
ment is true about this situation?

A.  The letter of credit can be processed and the funds paid because the customer is not

on the SDN List, and the SDN does not have a majority or controlling interest.

B.  The letter of credit can be processed and the funds paid because the US Office of
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has issued general licenses exempting food from
US sanctions.

C. The letter of credit must be blocked by the US bank and reported to OFAC even

though no funds have yet been received.

D. The letter of credit cannot be accepted or acted on so it must be returned to the

advising bank with notice that any funds received will be blocked.

Q 11-3. A small regional bank has recently started using a new transaction monitoring tool
that utilizes several custom scenarios to identify specific activity which was defined by the
Financial  Crimes  Compliance  team.  There  are  five  scenarios  that  are  live  in  production.
The Analytics team within Financial Crimes Compliance has performed some research on
the scenarios and is ready to make recommendation to management regarding possible
changes to the scenarios.

Which scenario(s) should the Analytics team recommend making changes to first?

A.  Scenario A that has generated 100 alerts in the past three months and 50 percent of
those have been deemed suspicious and a suspicious transaction report was filed.

B.  Scenario B that has generated 180 alerts with a 95 percent false positive rate.

C. Scenario C that has generated no alerts and there appears to be a problem with the

mapping of data.

D. Scenarios D and E that were put into production in the last 30 days to address a

matter requiring attention from a regulator.

CYBERSECURITY

 OVERVIEW

The  international  financial  system,  like  many  other  segments

of the private and public sectors, has been transformed by the

technological  developments  of  recent  decades.  Tools  such  as

online  banking,  electronic  funds  transfers  and  virtual  curren-

cies have moved a huge portion of the world’s economic activity

and financial transactions into the digital realm.

238

Financial criminals have followed closely behind,
quickly  adopting  and  exploiting  online  and  elec-
tronic  tools  to  their  own  illicit  ends.  Fraudsters
use  social  networks  to  make  connections  and
lend legitimacy to their false investments or non-
existent  business  enterprises.  Organized  crime
rings  use  elaborate  schemes  to  implant  mal-
ware on the computers of businesses worldwide,
obtain  passwords  and  login  information,  and
drain  millions  from  business  accounts.  Hackers,
acting alone or in teams, breach the data systems
of  major  corporations  and  government  agen-
cies to steal and resell customer data, from bank
account access codes to credit card and tax iden-
tification numbers.

It  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  financial  crime
has moved into a new digital era, and protecting
networks  and  data  is  essential  to  detecting  and
preventing a wide range of financial crimes. Con-
sequently, a working knowledge of cybersecurity
is  rapidly  becoming  a  necessity  for  all  financial
crime professionals.

For the purposes of this Manual, the term cyber-
security is used in a broad sense. It encompasses
methods to recognize, prevent and detect cyber-
crimes, as well as the understanding of the recom-
mended controls to prevent unauthorized access
from  external  actors.  Recognizing  that  employ-
ees  and  other  internal  sources  are  a  significant
financial crime risk as well, the concept of cyber-
security also includes policies and procedures to
safeguard against unauthorized internal access.

Additionally,  data  management  and  data  privacy
also  form  another  key  component  of  cybersecu-
rity,  and  this  chapter  will  provide  guidance  on
standards  for  retaining  and  destroying  sensitive
data,  sharing  data  with  law  enforcement  and
transmitting data across international borders.

Cybercrimes,  or  criminal  activities  conducted
using  online  and  electronic  tools,  can  intersect
with financial crimes in a variety of ways. Some,
like account takeovers previously mentioned, are

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

financial  crimes  in  and  of  themselves,  designed
to  directly  steal  assets  from  financial  accounts.
Other cybercrimes, such as online identity theft
and  data  breaches,  are  often  one  element  in  a
wider  financial  crime  scheme.  Personal  data
stolen  online,  for  example,  may  later  be  used  to
create  a  false  identity  to  apply  for  government
benefits as part of a fraud scheme. Systems and
networks  can  also  be  tampered  with  to  dis-
guise illicit transactions or destroy evidence of a
financial crime.

Globally,  incidents  of  cyber  financial  crime  have
exploded in recent years. A report by cyber secu-
rity  firm  Symantec  estimated  that  in  2011  more
than  232  million  customer  records  were  sto-
len  from  private  corporations  across  the  globe.
Worldwide,  40  percent  of  all  cyberattacks  tar-
geted financial institutions, according to the 2012
Data Breach Investigations Report by Verizon.

The  type  of  entities  orchestrating  cybercrimes
has  also  changed  considerably  over  the  past
decade.  Increasingly  sophisticated  organized
crime,  terrorist  and  activist  groups  have  moved
into  the  cybercrime  field,  either  for  profit  or  to
further  a  political  or  ideological  agenda.  State-
sponsored group and military organizations also
have  a  growing  online  presence,  engaging  in
covert  cyber  warfare  operations  that  strike  not
only  government  agencies  but  unwitting  targets
in the private sector.

Financial  institutions  of  all  types  and  sizes  are
particularly  at  risk.  Their  online  banking  and
transaction  services  and  wealth  of  potentially
valuable customer data make them rich pickings
for traditional cybercriminals seeking money and
assets.  At  the  same  time,  their  strategic  impor-
tance  makes  institutions  attractive  targets  to
state-sponsored  groups  looking  to  disrupt  a
country’s  economy,  or  “hacktivists”  trying  to
send a message.

All  these  factors  make  cybersecurity  a  criti-
cal  front  in  the  battle  against  financial  crime.

that data directly or use that data to illicitly gain
control over funds, accounts or assets.

The sheer variety of cyber financial crimes would
make it impractical to assemble a comprehensive
list  here,  and  constantly-changing  tactics  and
technologies  would  be  likely  to  make  such  a  list
obsolete  soon  after  it  was  published.  This  sec-
tion  examines  some  of  the  common  techniques
employed  in  cyber  financial  crime,  but  it  should
be  noted  that  these  techniques  are  very  often
used in combination with one another. A phishing
attack  by  e-mail  may  steal  one  element  of  con-
fidential  data  needed  to  access  a  bank  account,
while  keystroke-  logging  malware  may  gather
another,  with  the  end  result  being  a  successful
account takeover scheme.

Whether  investigating  cyber  financial  crimes  or
building  controls  to  prevent  them,  the  financial
crime specialist should look out for the ways that
one cybercrime can feed into and amplify another,
and likewise understand how one data breach can
leave an entire account or network vulnerable.

 SOCIAL ENGINEERING
Broadly  defined,  social  engineering  is  the  act  of
deceiving  or  manipulating  a  target  into  turning
over  confidential  information  or  personal  data.
This  differs  from  using  technical  hacking  tech-
niques,  such  as  computer  programs  that  crack
passwords  or  break  encryption.  In  recent  years,
cyber  financial  crime  schemes  have  become
increasingly  reliant  on  social  engineering,  and
the majority of data thefts from corporations and
financial  institutions  currently  involve  some  ele-
ment of social engineering.

Although  the  term  “social  engineering”  was
coined  in  the  90s,  the  strategies  it  relies  on  are
much older, and are essentially the same as what
con men and fraudsters have been using for hun-
dreds  of  years.  Assisted  by  technology,  social
engineering  schemes  exploit  human  tendencies
to trust appearances and take communications at

240

It  is  important  to  note  that  cybersecurity  is  a
fast-evolving  field,  with  rapidly  developing  tech-
nologies.  The  material  presented  here  collects
and  synthesizes  best  practices  from  a  variety  of
public and private sector sources. As always, the
financial  crime  specialist  should  seek  to  apply  it
to  the  specific  circumstances  of  their  organiza-
tion and profession.

RECOGNIZING AND DETECTING
CYBER FINANCIAL CRIME
Cyber  financial  crimes  may  have  emerged  more
recently  than  their  real-world  counterparts,  but
they  are  rapidly  becoming  just  as  diverse  and
pervasive.  With  only  a  computer  and  Internet
connection required for many crimes, the barrier
to entry is quite low, and cybercrime schemes are
often  limited  only  by  the  criminal’s  imagination
and ingenuity.

It  is  important  to  recognize  that  cyber  crim-
inals  may  have  a  wide  range  of  motives.  Not  all
cybercrimes  are  driven  by  the  pursuit  of  finan-
cial  gain,  and  not  all  can  be  considered  finan-
cial  crimes.  A  state-sponsored  cyber-espionage
unit  may  breach  a  defense  contractor’s  network
in  order  to  steal  military  technology,  for  exam-
ple,  or  a  hacker  may  vandalize  a  website  purely
for  their  own  amusement  and  bragging  rights.
Cyber financial crimes have a profit motive, and
primarily revolve around efforts to obtain or steal
data,  with  the  ultimate  goal  being  to  either  sell

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

face  value,  particularly  those  from  authoritative
persons or sources.

Social  engineering  schemes  can  and  often  do
occur  through  multiple  channels.  Some  social
engineering schemes may use phone calls imper-
sonating a bank employee, auditor or law enforce-
ment agent to deceive a target into turning over
confidential  information.  Others  may  use  social
networks  to  contact  targets,  build  credibility  by
conducting  background  research  on  targets,  or
create fake profiles to impersonate a target’s real
friends or business associates.

Criminals leveraging social engineering schemes
have  even  appeared  in-person  at  financial  insti-
tutions and other companies posing as “security
consultants” or law enforcement agents, in order
to  steal  data  from  internal  networks  or  install
malware  on  company  computers.  However,  by
far the most common type of social engineering
is  phishing  through  electronic  communications,
which is explained in more detail below.

Consequently,  there  is  no  one-size-fits-all  strat-
egy  for  guarding  against  social  engineering  at
organizations, whether banks, businesses or gov-
ernment  agencies.  One  low-tech,  but  effective,
solution is employee training.

PHISHING
Phishing refers to the act of sending an email or
other electronic message falsely claiming to be a
legitimate communication in order to manipulate
the recipient into providing confidential informa-
tion. Typically, a phishing message will direct the
recipient  to  a  sham  website  with  the  same  look
and  feel  as  the  legitimate  website  of  a  business,
government  agency  or  other  organization,  and
instruct  the  unsuspecting  user  to  divulge  sensi-
tive  information  such  as  passwords,  credit  card
numbers  and  bank  account  information.  The
website,  however,  is  not  genuine  and  solely  cre-
ated in an attempt to steal the user’s information.

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

Traditionally,  phishing  has  been  a  technique
intended  to  facilitate  identity  theft  schemes  tar-
geting  customers  of  financial  institutions.  Over
the  past  several  years,  phishers  have  expanded
their  targets,  attacking  government  agencies
such  as  the  US  Internal  Revenue  Service,  and
social networking websites in an attempt to steal
personal identifying information also used in the
commission of various identity theft and account
take over schemes.

There are several variations to phishing attempts:

Email Phishing. The most common form of phish-
ing is via email. Phishers ‘spam,’ or send the same
phishing  email  to  millions  of  individual  e-mail
addresses,  requesting  the  recipient  to  divulge
personal information under false pretenses. They
typically send  the victims to a fake  website that
looks  almost  identical  to  the  actual  site  the  vic-
tims thought they were going to. These pieces of
information  are  then  used  by  phishers  for  vari-
ous  illegal  activities,  but,  most  commonly,  to
facilitate an identity theft scheme. Most phishing
email messages have an urgent subject line which
requests  the  user  to  enter  their  credentials  to
update  account  information,  change  passwords
or verify account details.

These  types  of  attack  have  a  relatively  low  suc-
cess  rate  now  that  people  are  more  skilled  at
recognizing these types of email. But even a tiny
success  rate  on  the  millions  of  phishing  emails
sent per day means that many still fall victim to
this type of attack.

Man-in-the-Middle  Attack.  Man-in-the-Middle
Attacks are one of the more sophisticated phish-
ing  techniques  in  which  the  phisher  is  virtually
located  in  between  the  legitimate  website  and
the user terminal. The phisher intercepts details
during a transaction between the legitimate web-
site and the user. As the users enter their personal
information,  it  is  then  captured  by  the  phishers
without the user’s knowledge.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

241

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

Man-in-the-Middle  attacks  require  far  more
sophistication that standard phishing attacks, but
are  far  more  successful.  Since  victims  are  going
to the real website of the organization in the link
provided,  and  the  safeguards  users  might  have
installed  to  recognize  phishing  sites,  like  antivi-
rus or browser controls, will not detect this.

Instant  Messaging  Phishing.  Similar  to  email
phishing, instant message phishing is the method
by  which  the  user  receives  a  message  via  an
instant  messaging  software  program  with  a  link
directing  them  to  a  phishing  website  which  has
the same look and feel as the legitimate website.
The user is then prompted to enter their personal
information.

SMS  Phishing.  Similar  to  IM  Phishing,  SMS
Phishing  (also  known  as  Smishing),  is  sending
SMS  messages  to  people’s  phones  with  links  to
site that will capture their information.

Voice  Phishing.  Also  known  as  Vishing,  this  is  a
very  straight  forward  type  of  social  engineering
in which a scammer simply calls an organization
and pretends to be someone in authority to con-
vince the person they called to reveal passwords
and  other  confidential  information.  Skilled  con
men  can  be  surprisingly  successful  at  eliciting
information from a victim over a phone.

Spear-Phishing.  A  more  refined  phishing  tech-
nique,  spear-phishing  involves  sending  targeted

Attacks. Source: U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

242

messages  with  information  or  content  tailored
to  a  specific  recipient,  thereby  increasing  the
likelihood  they  will  believe  it  is  a  genuine  mes-
sage.  What  distinguishes  spear-phishing  from
traditional  phishing  schemes  that  typically  rely
on template messages sent out to large numbers
of  recipients,  is  the  inclusion  of  some  personal
information about the recipient.

Spear-phishing  messages  can  be  quite  sophisti-
cated,  and  may  include  the  subject’s  name  and
personal  identifying  information.  They  may  also
mimic  messages  from  a  recipient’s  friends,  rela-
tions or business associates. Spear-phishers must
have  some  level  of  information  on  their  recipi-
ent in  order to make their message  seem  plausi-
ble, and as a result, spear-phishing is often used
in  combination  with  data  breaches  or  theft.  For
example,  a  phisher  may  gather  some  personal
details on a subject by stealing them from a com-
pany database, and then use that information to
follow  up  with  a  directed  phishing  message  to
obtain login credentials for a bank account.

Victims  are  far  more  likely  to  be  susceptible  to
a  spear  phishing  attempt  that  a  simple  tem-
plate-based  phishing  attempt.  Many  people  by
second  nature  recognize  the  standard  phishing
attempts that fill our email boxes and delete them
by  reflex.  The  inclusion  of  some  individuality  to
the  attempt  makes  it  appear  far  more  authentic
and is much more likely to be successful.

BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE
Business  email  compromise  (BEC)  is  a  variant
of  social  engineering  that  has  been  lucrative
for  cybercriminals.  In  simple  terms,  a  fraudster
impersonates  someone  else  via  email  to  deceive
a  target  into  making  a  wire  transfer,  processing
a  payment  or  otherwise  taking  actions  that  will
transmit funds to the attackers.

In  one  common  example,  cybercriminals  send
a  message  to  a  company  employee  in  accounts
payable  or  the  finance  department  that  appears
to be sent from the company CEO, CFO or other

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

executive.  The  message  will  request  immediate
payment to a vendor or other party, indicating it’s
a very urgent matter – the payment must be com-
pleted before the close of business.

Of  course,  no  such  vendor  exists.  The  message
includes  payment  instructions  to  an  account
controlled  by  the  cyberfraudster,  typically  in
another  country.  Once  transferred,  the  funds
will  be  laundered  through  further  accounts  and
effectively disappear.

Attackers  will  either  spoof  the  sender’s  email
address or create a new address that looks nearly
identical.  In  other  cases,  attackers  obtain  a  tar-
get’s  email  account  credentials  and  take  control
of it to send messages.

In  a  variation,  messages  are  sent  directly  to  a
financial  institution,  purportedly  from  a  busi-
ness  executive  controlling  the  account,  direct-
ing  that  funds  be  transferred  to  another  party
immediately.

Another tactic is for cybercriminals to imperson-
ate a supplier or vendor, and contact a company
with  updated  account  information  for  monthly
payments. In one case in 2016, a Lithuanian man
was  able  to  steal  $100  million  from  tech  giants
Google and Facebook in a matter of months using
this technique.

Attackers  will  either  spoof  the  sender’s  email
address, or create a new address that looks nearly
identical.  In  other  cases,  attackers  obtain  a  tar-
get’s email account credentials, and take control
of it to send messages. Overall, the FBI estimated
that BEC was responsible for $3.1 billion in losses
in 2016 alone.

PROTECTING AGAINST BEC ATTACKS
Fortunately,  there  are  some  relatively
low-
tech  policies  and  procedures  that  you  can  use
to  protect  against  BEC  and  other  social  engi-
neering attacks.

One  is  requiring  more  than  one  employee  in  a
company  to  authorize  a  wire  transfer,  vendor
account  update  or  transmittal  of  sensitive  data.
Depending  on  the  size  and  sensitivity,  you  may
require multiple individuals to sign off.

Another  is  verifying  with  the  person  who  sup-
posedly sent the email. This confirmation should
always be done through an outside channel, such
as known phone numbers or company web sites
- not by replying to the email, text or voice mes-
sage,  or  calling  any  numbers  provided  in  the
message,  as  these  are  likely  to  be  controlled  by
the fraudster.

Ongoing training and awareness on the part of all
employees is perhaps the best defense. Like other
forms of fraud, social engineering often preys on
the  shared  human  desire  to  be  helpful,  and  the
tendency to take things at face value.

Every  individual  should  maintain  a  level  of  pro-
fessional  skepticism  when  dealing  with  email,
text and phone communications, especially those
that  are  out  of  the  ordinary.  Simple  steps  like
reviewing  an  email  header,  checking  hyperlinks
in  a  text  a  message  before  clicking,  or  scanning
email  attachments  before  opening  can  head  off
a  social  engineering  attack  before  it  starts.  A
company’s  networks  are  only  as  secure  as  their
weakest point.

PREVENTION & DETECTION OF SOCIAL
ENGINEERING ATTACKS
The  most  effective  method  in  the  detection  of
potential  cyber  fraud  is  to  stay  educated  and
up-to-date  on  phishing  techniques  and  identity
theft  schemes,  as  well  as  become  familiar  with
the channels that legitimate organizations use to
communicate  with  their  customers.  Legitimate
companies and government agencies will almost
never  request  personal  identifying  information
via  electronic  communication.  Any  electronic
information
communication  requesting  such
should be treated as highly suspicious.

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

Other prevention steps include the following:

•  Verify the hyperlinks within electronic

communication. This can usually be done by
hovering a mouse cursor over links to view
the true URL, although this is not a sure-fire
solution, as links can be masked.

•  Remain cautious about opening electronic

communication attachments and
or downloading files from electronic
communication. If the message is suspect or
not from a known source, at a minimum, files
should be scanned by antivirus program.

•  Never send personal or financial information

via electronic communication, and only
provide personal or financial information
through an organization’s website once it has
been reviewed to ensure its legitimacy

ACCOUNT TAKEOVER
Account  takeover  is  one  of  the  more  common
forms  of  identity  theft,  occurring  when  a  fraud-
ster obtains unauthorized access to an individual
or  organization’s  financial  accounts.  The  nature
of the takeover and the level of sophistication can
vary. In the simplest form, an attacker could use
malware, phishing or other techniques to obtain
a person’s online banking credentials, then access
the account and initiate transfers.

More  elaborate  attacks  might  gain  account  cre-
dentials  and  some  personally  identifying  infor-
mation  (such  as  the  victim’s  tax  identification
number or answers to online security questions)
and use this to change the official mailing address
or online banking credentials with that individu-
al’s financial institution. Once accomplished, the
fraudster can perform unauthorized transactions
using  the  victims  account  without  the  victim’s
knowledge ( cash withdrawals, check orders, wire
transfers, online banking transactions, etc.).

Account  take  over  (ATO)  schemes  are  often  the
end result of a combination of many identity theft
tactics used to obtain personal information. ATO

244

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

schemes can impact nearly any financial product
or  account  type  across  all  customer  segments
within  a  financial  institution,  including  individ-
ual customers, small-business customers, private
banking  customers  and  large  commercial  and
corporate  customers.  Small  businesses  and  non-
profit  organizations  are  an  especially  common
target of ATO attacks, as they typically hold more
funds in their accounts than individuals, but tend
to have less robust cybersecurity programs than
larger organizations.

Although it is difficult to produce hard numbers
on  losses,  some  security  analysts  estimate  that
$2 to $3 billion per year is stolen solely from US
accounts  in  account  takeover  attacks.  In  a  2011
survey  of  more  than  500  US  small  businesses
conducted  by  a  cybersecurity  firm,  56  percent
of  the  respondents  said  they  had  been  targets
of  fraud  involving  electronic  payments  in  the
past  year.  About  75  percent  of  those  said  they
were  the  subject  of  an  attempted  or  successful
account takeover.

As  previously  mentioned,  account  takeovers  are
often  the  end  result  of  identity  theft  schemes.
Social  engineering  and  phishing  are  common
methods  to  obtain  the  data  needed  to  take  con-
trol  of  a  financial  account,  as  are  malware  such
as  trojans  and  keystroke  loggers,  which  will  be
discussed later in this chapter. In addition, illicit
actions in the real world, such as mail theft or the
theft  of  personal  items  or  documents,  dumpster
diving and even “shoulder surfing” (surreptitiously
watching a person as they log in to accounts) can
be used to support ATOs.

The  adaptability,  breadth  and  combination  of
such schemes make them increasingly difficult to
detect and prevent, as it is often very difficult to
determine  the  root  causes  and  how  an  account
take over scam was perpetrated. Other methods
to prevent ATO schemes, as well as mitigate the
damage should they occur, include the following:

•  Protecting the cyber environment. A cyber

environment should be guarded just as would

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

cash or assets in a physical location. Do
not use unprotected Internet connections.
Sensitive data should be encrypted, and virus
protections should be updated regularly.

•  Using complex passwords that are changed
regularly. This can make it more difficult for
financial criminals behind ATOs to capture
a password, or guess it if they have already
gathered other personal data.

•  Multifactor or strong authentication. These
are systems that require multiple pieces of
evidence to verify a user before they are
allowed access to an account. Traditionally, a
multifactor system requires 2 of 3 “factors” to
allow access, which are:

 » Something a user knows (password or

personal information)

 » Something the user has (typically a

card or token)

 » Something the user is (fingerprints, voice ID

or other biometric identification)

•  Multi-channel authentication. Although a

robust system for verifying users, multifactor
authentication is not always practical
online. In its place, some organizations use
multichannel authentication to verify a user
or confirm a transaction, especially if it is
suspicious or above a certain threshold.
One simple example of multichannel
authentication would be an institution that
asks users to log in to their account with a
standard password and username, and then
has an employee call or text the user to
confirm before executing the transaction.

•  Understanding responsibilities and

liabilities. Many account agreements with
a bank or financial institution detail what
reasonable security measures are required
to protect accounts. In some cases, these
may direct an accountholder to implement
measures. It is critical that users understand
and implement the security safeguards in
the agreement. If they do not, they could be
liable for losses resulting from a takeover.

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

CASE STUDY - EPSILON DATA BREACH

On March 30, 2011, network security at Epsilon,
the  world’s  largest  distributor  of  permission-
based email, was breached and millions of per-
sonal  email  addresses  were  exposed.  At  the
time, Epsilon was sending 40 billion marketing
emails  per  year  for  2,500  corporate  custom-
ers, including Best Buy, Capital One, JPMorgan
Chase, Citi, Home Shopping Network and oth-
ers. The company was believed to store more
than 250 million e-mail addresses.

The company had been warned by ReturnPath,
a  cyber-security  firm,  in  2010  to  prepare  for
an increase in phishing and hacking attempts
against  email  distributors.  Epsilon  heeded
the  warning  and  installed  additional  protec-
tion  that  was  designed  to  monitor  traffic  and
to  alert  administrators  of  unusual  activity  or
download  patterns.  Even  so,  these  counter-
measures  were  not  sufficient  to  detect  and
prevent  the  data  breach,  in  which  unknown
attackers  gained  access  to  servers  containing
tens of millions of names and e-mail addresses.

Epsilon  notified
its  corporate  customers
almost immediately of the security breach, and
these companies began to contact the individ-
uals  whose  email  addresses  had  been  com-
promised.  Epsilon  also  notified  enforcement
and  participated  in  an  extensive  investigation
with the Secret Service to determine how the
breach  happened  and  how  to  secure  against
further attacks.

What is significant about the Epsilon breach is
that attackers did not directly seek credit card
numbers or other sensitive financial data. The
attack was intended to steal individual e-mail
addresses,  names  and  other  personal  identi-
fying  information  of  individuals,  most  likely
to  support  other  cybercrime  schemes  like
spear-phishing attacks.

The  attack  began  with  basic  phishing  attacks
against  Epsilon  employees.  This  basic  phish-
ing  attack  sent  a  few  employees  to  a  fake
website  that  installed  malware  on  their  com-
puters.  This  malware  allowed  remote  hack-
ers  to  log  into  their  machine  via  the  internet
and access the data Epsilon had through their
own internal computers. As mentioned earlier,
this will likely result in spear-phishing attacks
against the final targets, the accounts at Epsi-
lon. Spear phishing attacks are usually geared
toward  account  takeovers  for  the  ultimate
financial goal.

This  is  an  example  of  how  multiple  types  of
attacks  can  be  cascaded  to  achieve  account
takeovers. Cyber criminals will continue to get
more  creative  to  accomplish  their  goals.  The
eventual  account  takeovers  that  might  result
from this attack will have required six or seven
steps. The cost of this attack on Epsilon’s rep-
utation,  and  ultimately  its  bottom  line,  will
be staggering.

It is very important to note that all steps to pre-
vent account takeovers, as well as cybercrimes in
general,  should  be  proportionate  to  the  risks  of
the user and transaction.

Consequently,  not  every  user,  every  log  in  by  a
user, or every online transaction a user attempts
to  conduct  should  be  subject  to  the  same  secu-

rity  or  authentication  processes.  User  activity
and transactions must be assessed to determine
what is normal, and actions that deviate from that
baseline  should  receive  greater  scrutiny.  Trans-
actions  above  a  certain  threshold,  in  unusual
amounts or at odd dates or times, or an account
being  accessed  from  an  unknown  IP  address  or
location, should all be subject to stronger authen-

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

246

tication  and  monitoring  than  routine  transac-
tions or logins that fit the user’s typical patterns.

In some cases, an institution implementing what
it believes to be a rigorous approach can actually
be harmful if it is not tailored to specific risks and
situations. In one notable recent example, a small
bank was sued by a corporation whose business
account was taken over by an Eastern European
hacking gang. The judge ultimately ruled in favor
of  the  corporation  due  to  the  bank’s  insuffi-
cient data security policies and protections. One
shortcoming cited was the bank’s requiring users
to  answer  security  questions  before  conducting
any  transaction  above  $1,  which  gave  hackers
many opportunities to intercept the needed data
for the account takeover.

Although the bank considered this to be a robust
security  measure,  it  really  only  served  to  give
cybercriminals  more  chances  to  obtain  infor-
mation that would help them access the account.
Like  compliance  in  other  financial  crime  fields,
data  security  programs  and  controls  should  be
risk-based, not one-size-fits-all.

ACCOUNT TAKEOVER RED FLAGS
Red  flags  of  account  takeover  can  be  similar  to
those  for  other  forms  of  fraud,  which  is  to  say,
activity  that  does  not  have  a  clear  rationale  or
match  the  expected  behavior  of  the  customer.
Red  flags  can  also  include  actions  taken  in  an
online  banking  account  that  could  potentially
conceal  the  attacker’s  intrusion  from  detection.
Some examples include the following:

•  Logins to customer accounts and/or funds
transfers at unusual times of day or outside
of a customer’s normal hours

•  New accounts or payees linked to an online
account, followed by one or multiple funds
transfers initiated to these new accounts
shortly afterwards

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

•  A small funds transfer to a previously

unknown recipient, followed by one or more
larger transfers to the recipient in a short
period of time

•  A series of funds transfers to a recipient

located in another country or jurisdiction
that are uncharacteristic for the customer

•  Disabling or changing transaction alerts

and/or notifications in a customer’s online
banking accounts

•  Logins to a customer’s account from different

or unusual IP addresses

 USE OF MALWARE
Malware is a class of malicious or intrusive com-
puter code (or software application) that includes
viruses, trojan horses and computer worms used
by  attackers  to  obtain  personal/non-public  user
information. They can also be used to gain access
to or control over private computer systems and
databases,  or  interrupt  a  computer’s  functional-
ity  and  availability  to  its  users.  Malware’s  objec-
tive  is  typically  to  remain  undetected,  either
by  actively  hiding  within  a  computer  system  or
by  simply  not  making  its  presence  on  a  system
known to the user.

•  Computer Virus- a computer program

that can replicate itself and extend from
one computer to another through actions
undertaken by the user intervention to
proliferate.

•  Trojan horse or Trojan- a non-self-

replicating type of malware which appears
to perform a desirable function of a
legitimate software application but instead
facilitates unauthorized access to the user’s
computer system.

•  Computer Worm - a standalone malware
computer program that replicates for the
purposes of spreading to other computers
automatically.

One  common  type  of  malware  used  in  financial
crime schemes, which can be deployed as a Tro-

247

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

jan or worm, is a keystroke logger. This piece of
software runs surreptitiously on the background
of a user’s computer, capturing everything typed
on a computer’s keyboard and periodically trans-
mitting that information to another computer or
external  network.  Eventually,  those  keystrokes
are  parsed  and  analyzed  by  a  financial  criminal
to find passwords, logins and other sensitive per-
sonal  information.  There  are  a  number  of  varia-
tions on keystroke loggers, such as malware, that
secretly takes screenshots of a user’s computer.

Any  channel  used  to  connect  computers  and
transmit data can be exploited to spread malware.
Compromised websites or “attack sites” and mal-
ware  bundled  into  email  attachments  are  com-
mon vectors. Malware can also be packaged into
other  applications  downloaded  online,  including

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

legitimate  ones,  or  transferred  over  file-shar-
ing services.

Enterprising  cybercriminals  have  even  found
ways to program malware onto the “firmware” of
devices like wireless routers and USBs. Firmware
is the permanent software that comes embedded
into a device’s memory.

Advanced  cybercriminals  will  write  their  own
malware  programs,  but  more  common  is  pur-
chasing or modifying an existing one. Thousands
of  malware  applications  are  available  for  sale  or
even free download on web forums and dark web
marketplaces.

RANSOMWARE
Ransomware  is  one  strain  of  malware  that  has
proven  popular  among  cybercriminals  –  and

Quickly in the Ukraine and Europe.

highly  disruptive  for  their  victims.  Ransomware
prevents a user from accessing their computer or
locks files until a ransom is paid, typically through
cryptocurrencies.  Some  versions  are  a  form  of
“scareware,”  which  attempt  to  frighten  a  victim
into  paying  by  threatening  to  permanently  lock
or delete files, even though the program doesn’t
have that ability.

More advanced ransomware will actually encrypt
files.  Cybercriminals  will  then  only  provide  the
key to unlock them upon receipt of payment – if
they provide it at all.

Ransomware  is  available  in  a  “malware  as  a  ser-
vice” model, which accounted in part for its rapid
rise  in  popularity  in  the  mid  2010s.  On  the  dark
web,  a  cybercriminal  can  purchase  a  package
that  includes  a  ransomware  program  and  every-
thing needed to get it up and running, spamming
services  to  distribute  it,  cryptocurrency  wal-
lets  to  receive  payment,  and  even  ongoing  tech-
nical support.

It’s  not  just  individuals  that  have  been  targeted
by  ransomware.  Entire  companies  and  govern-
ment  agencies  have  had  operations  disrupted
and  networks  shut  down.  Ransomware  has  had
serious  impacts  on  critical  infrastructure,  such
as  healthcare  providers,  energy  companies  and
transportation  services.  In  2016,  a  global  ran-
somware  attack  dubbed  WannaCry  led  several
hospitals  in  the  UK’s  National  Health  Service  to
redirect patients and cancel surgeries after their
networks  were  hit  with  encryption.  Overall,  the
WannaCry program struck an estimated 200,000
computers across 150 countries.

One  of  the  best  safeguards  against  ransomware
is  robust  data  backups.  Organizations  should
ensure  that  they  are  backing  up  data,  especially
sensitive or essential data, on a regular basis and
in more than one location. To maximize the secu-
rity  of  sensitive  data,  backups  should  take  place
in  three  locations  –  internally,  on  a  location  off
their  internal  network,  and  on  a  third  external

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

location that is not connected to the internal net-
work or Internet.

MALWARE PREVENTION & DETECTION
The vast majority of Internet users globally have
knowingly  or  unknowingly  been  impacted  by  or
otherwise  been  exposed  to  malware.  Similar  to
phishing,  malware  presents  significant  risks  to
nearly any computer user as a result of the mali-
cious  code’s  ability  to  infect  users  either  in  an
undetectable  environment  or  embedded  within
legitimate software applications. Below are some
industry  best  practices  around  avoiding  mal-
ware attacks.

•  Use reputable antivirus software program
on computers, and keep the computer’s
operating system and anti-virus
software up to date.

•  Remain cautious about opening electronic

communication attachments and or
downloading files online, especially if the site
or source is unknown or unverified.

•  Browse the Internet responsibly by only

visiting reputable web sites.

•  Do not click on pop-up advertisements,

especially advertisements pertaining to anti-
virus or anti-spyware software.

Outside  of  programs  designed  explicitly  to  dis-
rupt  or  destroy  computer  networks,  malware  is
rarely  used  in  isolation  and  is  usually  a  means
of facilitating another crime. Although the steps
to  prevent  it  are  relatively  straightforward,  they
should be used in conjunction with other security
controls  and  protocols.  The  following  section  of
this  chapter  will  detail  some  industry  best  prac-
tices and standards for network security and the
detection and prevention of unauthorized access.

OTHER TYPES OF ATTACK
Network vulnerabilities are simply weaknesses in
a system that can be exploited by a cyber- threat.
Several system vulnerabilities are explained below

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

249

in detail. Reducing a system’s vulnerabilities will
reduce the number and impact of such threats.

IPL  (Initial  Program  Load)  vulnerabilities.  The
start  of  a  network  or  system,  called  the  initial
program  load  (IPL),  presents  very  specific  sys-
tem vulnerabilities. During the IPL, the operator
brings  up  an  organization’s  system  and  can  per-
form operations to compromise the security. An
operator  could  load  unauthorized  programs  or
data, reset passwords, rename various resources,
reset the system’s time and date and bypass the
security checks.

Traffic analysis. An intruder analyzes data char-
acteristics  (message  length,  message  frequency
and  so  forth)  and  the  patterns  of  transmissions
(rather  than  any  knowledge  of  the  actual  infor-
mation  transmitted)  to  infer  information  that
might be useful to an intruder.

Data scavenging attacks. This is the technique of
piecing  together  information  from  found  bits  of
data on a network, and using that data to expose
weaknesses or launch a cyberattack.

Network  address  hijacking.  It  may  be  possi-
ble for an intruder to reroute data traffic from a
server or network device to a personal machine,
either  by  device  address  modification  or  by  net-
work  address  “hijacking.”  This  diversion  enables
the  intruder  to  capture  traffic  to  and  from  the

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

devices  for  data  analysis  or  modification  or  to
steal the password file from the server and gain
access to user accounts

Representative Examples – Unauthorized
Network Access

•  The FBI arrested a computer programmer

in New York and charged him with stealing
proprietary software code from the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY). This
software, which handles all kinds of US
government financial transactions, cost more
than $9 million to develop.

•  A 31-year-old Russian national living in

New York, was charged with hacking into
accounts at Fidelity, Scottrade, E*Trade and
Schwab in a complex scheme that involved
making unauthorized trades that profited the
gang he recruited to open bank accounts to
receive the illegal proceeds. The brokerage
firms said they lost $1 million because
of his fraud.

•  Yahoo accidentally leaked the private key

that was used to digitally sign its new Axis
extension for Google Chrome. Axis is a new
search and browsing tool from Yahoo. A
security blogger discovered the package
including the private crypto key, noting it
offered a malicious attacker the ability “to
create a forged extension that Chrome will
authenticate as being from Yahoo.” Yahoo
was forced to release a new version of its
Axis extension for Google Chrome.

PLANNING A
CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM
Considering the amount of sensitive data within
their custody, such as personal identifying infor-
mation, financial records and other forms of non-
public  information,  cybersecurity  is  a  critical
element  for  most  companies  and  organizations.
Organizations  should  constantly  be  taking  pro-
active  measures  to  protect  themselves  against
internal  misuse  or  theft  of  data,  external  theft

250

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

of  data  and  the  threat  of  malware  intrusions  on
their networks.

Proper  cybersecurity  policies  and  procedures
allow organizations to effectively manage the pro-
tection  of  their  physical  and  financial  resources,
reputation,  legal  position,  employees,  and  other
tangible and intangible assets.

Some of the same core principles from the finan-
cial crime compliance arena also apply to cyber-
security.  One  of  these  is  assessing  risks  and
building  controls  and  protections  accordingly.  A
cyber security plan starts with a risk assessment.

The  following  are  introductory  steps  an  organi-
zation should consider when first deciding on its
cybersecurity approach:

•  Assess what networks and data are being
protected, which may include data from
clients, such as personally identifying
information of customers, an organization’s
own internal data, and the networks required
to run the organization’s operations.

•  Assess risks and cyber threats facing the

organization, and compare this against an
assessment of systems and information
requiring protect to determine the areas of
highest priority.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE—CYBER BANKING FRAUD

In  many  cases,  large  corporations  and  major
financial  institutions  are  less  vulnerable  to
cyber  attacks  than  smaller  organizations,  as
they  often  devote  considerable  resources  to
online  and  data  security.  As  a  result,  cyber-
criminals  frequently  target  the  accounts  of
medium-sized  companies,  towns,  non-profits
and  even  churches.  In  one  notable  example
from  2010,  members  of  an  account  takeover
ring  managed  to  steal  $70  million  from  small
and mid-size US organizations.

“This was a major theft ring,” said Gordon Snow,
assistant  director  of  the  FBI’s  Cyber  Division
in a statement after members of the ring were
arrested. “Global criminal activity on this scale
is a threat to our financial infrastructure, and
it  can  only  be  effectively  countered  through
the kind of international cooperation we have
seen in this case.”

Using  a  Trojan  horse  virus  known  as  Zeus,
hackers in Eastern Europe infected computers
around the world. The virus was carried in an
e-mail, and when targeted individuals at busi-
nesses  and  municipalities  opened  the  e-mail,

the  malicious  software  installed  itself  on  the
victimized  computer,  secretly  capturing  pass-
words, account numbers, and other data used
to log into online banking accounts.

The  hackers  used  this  information  to  take
over  the  victims’  bank  accounts  and  make
unauthorized  transfers  of  thousands  of  dol-
lars at a time, often routing the funds to other
accounts  controlled  by  a  network  of  “money
mules,”  many  recruited  from  overseas.  They
created  bank  accounts  using  fake  documents
and phony names, where money from hacked
accounts  was  transmitted.  Once  the  money
was  in  a  mule’s  account,  they  could  either
wire it back to their bosses in Eastern Europe
or  turn  it  into  cash  and  smuggle  it  out  of  the
country.  The  mules  received  a  commission
for  their  work,  and  some  were  unwitting  par-
ticipants  in  the  scheme,  believing  they  were
helping  a  real  business  to  conduct  legitimate
financial  transactions.  In  all,  the  global  theft
ring attempted to steal some $220 million and
was  actively  involved  in  using  Zeus  to  infect
more computers.

considering security is a daily issue.

•  Consider the human aspects of cybersecurity.
A 2014 study of cyber incidents by IBM found
that 90 percent had a human component
to them, meaning that the actions of an
employee helped further the cyber attack
rather than a purely technical failure. An
organization’s internal security practices
and training are as important as its controls
around network access from the outside.

•  Recognize that cybersecurity also has a

physical component. Attackers will use any
weak point to launch an attack, including
physical vulnerabilities. In past cases,
cyberfraudsters have posed as consultants
for a financial institution, using forged
security badges to enter the server room
and steal data directly off the institution’s
network. In another instance, criminals
simply stole the entire server racks.

•  Consider the potential repercussions for

cybersecurity incidents. Thinking through
the possible fallout that can result from a
data breach, malware disruption or other
attack can help an organization decide how
robust its data security program should be.
For example, a software company may lose
millions if their application source code is
discovered and made available to public.

STRUCTURE AND SAFEGUARDS
IN A NETWORK
In the simplest terms, a network can be described
as a collection of computers and other hardware
that are used to store information and carry out
the functions of an organization. With the expan-

The  Internet  is  defined  as  a  global  network  that
links  computers  worldwide  and  uses  data  trans-
fer  protocols,  such  as  FTP  and  HTTP,  to  trans-
fer  information  and  data  across  locations.  An
intranet is a private or closed network that uses
internet  technology.  For  example,  a  company’s
intranet  site  can  only  be  used  by  its  employees
and approved contractors to access specific non-
public  company  information  such  as  corporate
policies,  announcements,  corporate  financial
information,  employee  forums,  internal  job  post-
ings and event calendars.

An  extranet  is  a  computer  network  that  facili-
tates controlled access from the outside, for spe-
cific business or informative purposes. Access is
restricted to particular outside users and specific
information within the network. Information can
be shared from various areas of the business, and
can be used to communicate sales and customer
services,  product  development  and  marketing
and personnel recruitment, among other things.

For  example,  a  company  may  choose  to  share
product  information  with  its  business  partners,
or  it  may  use  electronic  document  interchange
(EDI) to allow customers to place orders, deliver
goods and process payments electronically.

To detect and prevent unauthorized access to or
use of an organization’s computers and networks,
it  is  necessary  to  develop  an  effective  frontline
of  security  mechanisms,  as  well  as  data  breach
detection  systems  to  discover  intrusions  and
thefts if they do occur.

Cybersecurity  does  not  take  place  solely  in  the
virtual world. Network, system and physical secu-
rity as well as controls for dealing with people are
required. The intangible aspects of data security
also  need  to  be  considered,  such  as  the  effects

of tight security controls on business operations
and company morale.

THE BASICS OF CYBERSECURITY
Best practices for securing an organization’s sys-
tems  and  data  can  be  grouped  into  two  broad
categories: those focused on organizational  poli-
cies and controls, and those focused on the train-
ing and procedures of individual employees. We’ll
look at the latter first.

Training  and  Awareness.  Human-centric  best
practices  start  with  training  and  awareness  on
the  part  of  all  employees.  Training  should  focus
on helping employees to modify their behavior to
reduce cyber risk. Employees should be aware of
the cyber threats they face, and understand how
their  day-to-day  actions  on  the  job  –  opening
email attachments, for example – can increase or
decrease their vulnerability for attack.

To  the  extent  possible,  organizations  should
extend  their  training  and  awareness  of  cyber
threats  to  their  customers.  For  example,  if  an
institution  is  seeing  a  rise  in  incidences  of  busi-
ness email compromise attacks affecting its cus-
tomer  accounts,  it  could  send  out  a  customer
alert warning them of the fraud trend and teach-
ing them what to look for.

Cyber  Hygiene.  All  staff  should  exercise  good
cyber  hygiene,  or  routine  practices  to  safe-
guard their own devices and online activity. This
includes  setting  strong  passwords  and  changing
them frequently, not reusing the same password
or passwords across multiple platforms, and run-
ning regular scans for malware.

Safe Browsing Practices. Individuals should prac-
tice safe search and browsing when maneuvering
online,  such  as  checking  hyperlinks  before  visit-
ing  sites,  avoiding  suspicious  or  untrustworthy
sites,  and  downloading  and  installing  software
only  from  trusted  sources.  Browser  extensions
that rate a site’s reputation or highlight sites with
security issues can assist with this.

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

Bring  Your  Own  Device  Policies.  Organizations
that allow employees to bring their own devices,
such  as  phones,  tablets  or  personal  computers,
into the workplace or otherwise connect them to
the  organization’s  network  should  have  security
policies and controls in place to manage this risk.
Devices infected with malware can compromise a
company’s network, and cybercriminals may use
employee devices as an attack channel.

Accessing WiFi and Storage Devices. Employees
should exercise caution when accessing wireless
networks and avoid connecting to any unsecured
networks. Cybercriminals can use these to target
others on the network, or may set up their own
network  to  lure  unaware  victims.  Likewise,  indi-
viduals  should  not  connect  to  unknown  devices
– a USB stick found in a company’s break room, for
example – as these could be vectors for malware.

ORGANIZATIONAL POLICIES
AND CONTROLS
Manage log of changes to the existing data net-
work. Any changes to the network, including ele-
ments such as software updates, authorized users
and  access  controls,  should  always  be  tracked
and accurately recorded in a network log. This log
should  be  accessible  to  all  IT  staff  and  adminis-
trators with permissions to make changes to the
network. System logs must be retained for 30 to
90 days and then destroyed unless further reten-
tion is necessary due to legal, regulatory or con-
tractual requirements.

Prevent keeping data for any more time than is
necessary.  Data  retention  and  deletion  policies
are an essential element of data security. All orga-
nizations should assess what data is being stored,
for what reasons, and on what time scale. In many
cases,  it  may  be  that  an  organization  is  preserv-
ing  more  data,  or  preserving  it  for  longer  time
periods,  than  is  necessary  which  is  more  expen-
sive  to  the  companies.  This  leaves  the  organiza-
tion  and  its  customers  more  vulnerable  to  data
theft and breaches. Data that is non-essential for

business, regulatory or legal reasons should usu-
ally be deleted.

Actively  monitor  fraudulent  human  behavior.
Unusual communication, requests outside of nor-
mal  workflow  and  instructions  to  provide  infor-
mation or take actions contrary to policies should
be  viewed  as  suspect.  Outbound  traffic  should
also be monitored to identify suspicious traffic.

Restrict  administrative  connections  to  spe-
cific  internal  sources,  and  do  not  allow  exter-
nal administrative access. Administrative access
typically  allows  a  user  full  control  to  install  or
delete programs, extract data or make changes to
the code in a computer or network. It can be very
dangerous  if  a  financial  criminal  gains  admin-
istrative  access  to  a  system,  and,  as  such,  orga-
nizations  should  maintain  restrictions  on  what
employees  and  functions  are  granted  adminis-
trative  access.  In  most  circumstances,  external
administrative access should not be allowed.

Implement  a  firewall  and  access  control  list.
This  is  a  basic  but  vital  step  for  protecting  an
organization’s  servers  that  can  be  accessed
externally -- firewalls are software or hardware
devices  (or  a  combination  of  both)  that  monitor
and  limit  access  to  traffic  flowing  into  and  out
of  the  network  based  on  predetermined  proto-
cols.  An  access  control  list  (ACL)  specifies  what
systems  or  users  have  permission  to  access  a
server or system.

Change  default  credentials  of  internet  facing
devices. The default or out-of-the-box passwords
or  login  information  should  always  be  changed
for  any  device  with  an  external  connection.  A
surprising  number  of  companies  will  connect
devices  that  can  be  accessed  externally  without
changing  vendor-supplied  usernames  and  pass-
words. Financial criminals will take advantage of
this  fact  to  easily  exploit  holes  in  the  data  secu-
rity  system.  Almost  all  password  cracking  tools
start with the list of default passwords from every
manufacturer.

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

Systems  must  be  configured  to  automatically
update any software. Operating system software,
server applications (webserver, mail server, data-
base  server,  etc.),  client  software  (web  brows-
ers, mail clients, office suites, etc.), and malware
protection  software
(antivirus,  anti-spyware,
etc.)  should  all  be  updated  automatically  to  pro-
tect  against  constantly-shifting  threats.  A  plan
to  manually  apply  new  updates  within  a  docu-
mented time period is an acceptable alternative.

Partitioning.  This  means  that  systems  and  net-
works should share hardware and resources only
with  other  systems  that  have  similar  security
requirements. Systems which share similar secu-
rity requirements should have user communities
of similar size and character, similar firewall pro-
files, and similar technical requirements.

OTHER NETWORK SECURITY
STANDARDS AND INDUSTRY
BEST PRACTICES
In  most  circumstances,  a  financial  crime  profes-
sional  will  not  be  required  to  have  a  specialized
knowledge  of  network  security.  However,  some
fluency  in  the  more  technical  aspects  of  cyber-
security  can  be  useful  in  compliance,  investiga-
tions  and  enforcement  matters.  Below  are  some
slightly  more  advanced  techniques  and  tools  for
safeguarding networks:

•  Avoid using point-of-sale systems to

connect to the web directly, and ensure your
point-of-sale system is compliant with the
requirements designed by the Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) to
ensure that all companies that process, store
or transmit credit card information maintain
a secure environment.

•  Use encryption and decryption methods to
convert information into a version that is
meaningful only when the intended recipient
uses a key or code when transferring files.
Strong encryption methodologies, such
as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES),

which uses the same key to encrypt and
decrypt data, can be used for particularly
sensitive information such as credit card
numbers, bank account information and
payment details.

your company’s confidentiality and security
standards for handling customer information
at the time of hiring. If this has not previously
been done, all current employees should also
be required to sign such an agreement.

•  Adopt inspection firewalls on network

•  Limiting access to customer information to

connections, which are the most common
firewalls in use today. These firewalls
track the state of a network connection
to determine if a packet of data being
transmitted to or from the network should
be filtered. Proxy firewalls allow deeper
packet inspection for more granular control
and authentication.

•  Require password changes upon suspicion

of theft or data breach for all users. In some
cases, this may include notifying customers
and requiring them to change passwords as
well. For very secure data or transactions,
organizations could also consider using one-
time or limited-use passwords.

employees who have a business reason to see
it. For example, give employees who respond
to customer inquiries access to customer
files, but only to the extent they need it to do
their jobs, and do not grant the same access
privileges to employees in the organization’s
research and development department, who
have no reason to view customer files.

•  Controlling access to sensitive information
by requiring employees to use “strong”
passwords that must be changed on a regular
basis. (Tough-to-crack passwords require
the use of at least six characters, upper- and
lower-case letters, and a combination of
letters, numbers, and symbols).

•  Consider blocking large address blocks/

•  Using password-activated screen savers

regions if they have no legitimate business
purpose, also known as IP blacklisting.
Similarly, an organization could use a web
content filter to check every URL request
originating from its network against a
blacklist of undesirable websites.

PROTECTING AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED
INTERNAL ACCESS
A  significant  percentage  of  data  breaches  and
thefts  involve  the  participation  of  insiders,  and
organizations  should  not  underestimate  the
threat  of  unauthorized  internal  access.  Depend-
ing  on  the  nature  of  their  business  operations,
firms  should  consider  implementing  the  follow-
ing practices:

•  Thoroughly checking references or

conducting background checks before hiring
employees who will have access to customer
information.

•  Requiring new employees to sign an

agreement committing them to following

to lock employee computers after a period
of inactivity.

•  Developing policies for the use and

protection of mobile devices, including
laptops, PDAs and cell phones. For example,
implement a policy of encrypting any user
data that is kept or transferred on to a mobile
device, and provide training to employees
using such devices on properly storing and
using them in secure locations.

•  Providing training to employees on the steps
they should take to maintain the security,
confidentiality and integrity of customer
information.

MONITORING AND TESTING FOR
CYBERSECURITY
Cybersecurity  testing  and  network  intrusion
monitoring  is  an  ongoing  and  evolving  effort  to
ensure  protection  against  new  and  dynamic
threats to networks. A critical aspect of any secu-

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

255

rity program is proactive testing and monitoring
procedures that remains flexible and dynamic.

Vulnerability  assessments  and  penetration  test-
ing should occur when a cybersecurity program
is first put into place, as well as periodically on an
ongoing  basis.  In  simple  terms,  penetration  test-
ing involves conducting an authorized attack on a
network or system, in order to assess the strength
of security measures and identify weak points.

An  intrusion  detection  system  (IDS)  is  a  device
or software application that monitors network or
system activities for malicious activities or policy
violations and produces reports to a management
station.  Some  systems  may  attempt  to  stop  an
intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor
expected of a monitoring system.

Intrusion  detection  and  prevention  systems
(IDPS)  are  primarily  focused  on  identifying  pos-
sible  incidents,  logging  information  about  them,
and reporting attempts. In addition, organizations
use  IDPSs  for  other  purposes,  such  as  identify-
ing problems with security policies, documenting
existing  threats  and  deterring  individuals  from
violating  security  policies.  IDPSs  have  become  a
necessary addition to the security infrastructure
of nearly every organization.

IDPSs  typically  record  information  related  to
observed events, notify security administrators of
important observed events, and produce reports.
Many IDPSs can also respond to a detected threat
by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They
use  several  response  techniques,  which  involve
the IDPsS stopping the attack itself, changing the
security  environment  (e.g.  reconfiguring  a  fire-
wall), or changing the attack’s content.

OTHER MONITORING AND TESTING
INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES

•  Routine log monitoring

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

•  Flagging and monitoring failed login
attempts (especially those indicating
widespread sequential guessing)

•  Locking out accounts after a specified

number of tries

•  Requiring help desk calls for account lockouts

•  Enforcing password policies (length,

complexity, clipping levels)

•  Password throttling (increasing lag in a

computer or system after successive failed
logins, to prevent malware from running
multiple rapid password guesses)

•  Password cracking tests

When  creating  and  implementing  cybersecurity
programs,  understanding  legal  and  regulatory
duties  is  essential.  Many  jurisdictions  have  laws
or  regulations  that  lay  out  the  requirements  for
cybersecurity programs, including when and how
to report cyber incidents.

One  example  is  the  Directive  on  Network  and
Information  Security,  which  establishes  cyber-
security standards for organizations in European
Union member states. In the US, the state of New
York implemented Rule 500 in 2017, which lays out
detailed cybersecurity program requirements for
financial institutions.

DATA RETENTION AND DELETION
Many  jurisdictions  also  have  requirements  for
retaining various types of records. The US and its
states are one example. In the state of Texas for
example, disability and sick benefit records must
be retained for six years and claims of employee
inventions must be retained for 25 years. Accord-
ing  to  US  federal  law,  financial  account  records
must be retained a minimum of five years after an
account is closed.

Depending on the nature of your business, there
may  be  multiple  agencies  that  have  their  own
specific  requirements.  Even  if  an  organization
does  not  have  explicit  regulatory  mandates,

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

256

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

data  retention  and  deletion  policies  and  proce-
dures are still an important part of a cybersecu-
rity program.

Data retention policy is generally written by legal
counsel with the help of security personnel, and
it should include the following:

“It is only a matter of time
before your organization
gets hit with some type of
cyber incident.”

•  Purpose of the policy

•  Who is affected by this policy

•  The type of data and electronic systems

covered by this policy

•  Define key terms especially legal and

technical terminology

•  Describe the requirements in detail from the

legal, business and personal perspective

•  Outline the procedures for ensuring data is

properly retained

•  Outline the procedures for ensuring data is

properly destroyed

•  Clearly document the litigation

exception process and how to respond to
discovery requests

•  A list of responsibilities for those involved in

data retention activities

Data retention and disposal takes the cooperation
of  many  departments:  Legal,  Human  Resources,
IT and Management, to name a few. It is also the
responsibility of all employees to do their best at
complying with the data retention policy.

When  involved  in  litigation,  organizations  in
most  jurisdictions  will  be  required  to  retain  all
pertinent  to  the  case  or  anything  likely  to  lead
to  the  discovery  of  admissible  evidence,  and
provide  it  to  lawyers  or  court  officials  upon
request in a timely manner. Otherwise, potential
evidence could be destroyed either intentionally
or accidentally.

The  important  thing  is  to  understand  what
absolutely must be saved and then make a good
faith  effort  to  follow  your  defined  process  to

the  best  of  your  ability.  Don’t  forget  to  exercise
caution during litigation, and try to plan ahead for
how you would respond.

It  can  be  tempting  for  some  organizations  to
retain  as  much  data  as  they  possibly  can,  either
out  of  an  abundance  of  caution,  or  because
storage  is  inexpensive  and  widely  accessible.
However,  this  “save  everything”  approach  often
does not align with cybersecurity best practices.
Storing  more  information  can  lead  to  increased
risk  that  data  is stolen,  misused  or  mismanaged.
Instead, organizations should put in place policies
for  removing  data  when  it  is  no  longer  required
for a business, legal or regulatory purpose.

Organizations should be cautious about how they
delete information to ensure that it is completely
and  fully  removed.  Simply  deleting  information
off one computer, or one folder on a server, may
not be sufficient, as data may be held in multiple
files, databases, or locations on a network.

RESPONDING TO A CYBER INCIDENT
Given  the  current  reality  of  the  cyber  threat
landscape,  it  is  likely  a  matter  of  time  before
your organization gets hit by some type of cyber
incident. An important part of your cybersecurity
program is how you react.

Organizations should create cyber preparedness
plans,  and  conduct  exercises  to  practice  in
advance  of  a  real  incident.  Assigning  leadership
roles,  staff  responsibilities,  and  processes  for
decision-making  in  advance  can  speed  up  the

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

•  Identify the sensitivity of the incident and
level of impact on the subjects and the
organization.

•  If data has been stolen, lost or corrupted,
establish whether the systems housing
the data can be accessed or used without
specialized knowledge or software. In the
aftermath of a cyber incident, the affected
computers and networks are a crime scene.
They need to be preserved and accessed
in a way that doesn’t interfere with efforts
to investigate and remediate. This often
requires cyber forensic expertise.

•  Identify whether data can be recovered

or the damage done by the attack can be
repaired. In many incidents, the answer will
be a resounding “no.” In certain situations
– files locked by ransomware, for example,
or fraudulent transactions initiated due
to business email compromise – it may be
possible to fully or partially reverse damages.

be  surprisingly  difficult  in  the  midst  of  a  cyber

territory,  it  will  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the
company  to  examine  the  legal  and  regulatory
disclosure requirements.

The  first  step  in  responding  to  a  cyber  incident
is  to  stop  the  bleeding.  Identify  the  gaps  and
vulnerabilities  that  led  to  the  attack,  and  close
them immediately.

Below is the list of other immediate actions a com-
pany should take in response to a cyberattack:

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

258

•  If needed, start drafting communications

for both public and private notifications to
subjects and the appropriate government
authorities.

•  Prepare a public relations strategy in the

event the loss is made public.

•  Consult legal advisors and determine if

the loss will be investigated internally or
undertaken by external consultants.

•  Establish if policies and procedures have
been broken and what disciplinary action
will be taken.

•  Review the incident against internal policies
and procedures to identify any weakness in
security and enhance the policies to avoid
future losses.

It can often be tempting for companies to simply
sweep  a  data  breach  under  the  rug  and  look  for
quick  fixes,  as  acknowledging  a  breach  can  lead
to loss of customers, negative publicity, and even
liability in extreme circumstances. Though it may
be  more  painful  in  the  short  term,  a  robust  and
thorough  response  to  cyber  incidents  is  always
the  best  in  the  long  run,  as  it  will  help  correct
deficient  policies  and  ultimately  lead  to  a  more
secure cybersecurity program.

ESSENTIALS OF A DATA
PRIVACY PROGRAM
STORING AND RETAINING
CUSTOMER INFORMATION
Many  companies  collect  personal  information
from their customers, including names, addresses
and phone numbers; bank and credit card account
numbers; income and credit histories; and Social
Security numbers. As custodians of this sensitive
personal  information,  organizations  must  have
policies  and  procedures  to  protect  data  privacy
and use data ethically.

These  are  similar  to  cybersecurity  programs,
but  have  slightly  different  goals.  Cybersecurity

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

focuses  on  preventing  unauthorized  access  to
networks or information, whereas data privacy is
focused on managing, using and sharing data in
a  way  that  conforms  to  privacy  regulations  and
customer  expectations.  This  can  include  how
data  are  handled  internally,  shared  with  affili-
ates or other third parties, or transmitted to law
enforcement and regulators.

Internationally, there is a patchwork of laws and
regulations  that  governs  how  sensitive  personal
information  should  be  stored  and  retained,  and
when  and  how  it  can  be  shared.  Collectively,
these  principles  provide  guidance  on  data  pri-
vacy programs.

Like  all  elements  of  cybersecurity,  data  privacy
programs  must  be  tailored  to  the  specific  types
of  information  collected  and  the  services  and
products  a  company  provides.  One  first  step  in
safeguarding data privacy is to develop a written
plan that describes their program to protect cus-
tomer information. The plan must be appropriate
to the company’s size and complexity, the nature
and  scope  of  its  activities,  and  the  sensitivity  of
the customer information it handles.

As  part  of  its  plan,  each  company  should  do
the following:

•  Designate one or more employees to

coordinate its privacy program.

•  Identify and assess the risks to customer
information in each relevant area of the
company’s operation, and evaluate the
effectiveness of the current safeguards for
controlling these risks.

•  Design and implement a privacy program,

and regularly monitor and test it.

•  Select service providers that can maintain
appropriate safeguards, make sure your
contract requires them to maintain
safeguards, and oversee their handling of
customer information.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

259

•  Evaluate and adjust the program in light of
relevant circumstances, including changes
in the firm’s business or operations, or the
results of security testing and monitoring.

Organizations  should
implement  safeguards
appropriate  to  their  own  circumstances.  A  com-
pany may decide to designate a single employee
to  coordinate  safeguards  or  may  assign  this
responsibility to several employees who will work
together.  In  addition,  companies  must  consider
and address any unique risks raised by their busi-
ness  operations,  such  as  the  risks  raised  when
employees  access  customer  data  from  their
homes  or  other  off-site  locations,  or  when  cus-
tomer data are transmitted electronically outside
the company network.

RESPONDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
REQUESTS FOR DATA
investigations  will  often  be
Financial  crime
accompanied by compulsory legal requests from
law  enforcement,  courts  or  private  litigants  for
data  or  information.  As  an  industry  best  prac-
tice when dealing with such requests, a financial
institution  or  firm  should  designate  a  specific
person  or  specific  office  to  receive  all  requests
for information and to coordinate the responses
to such requests.

With  the  possible  exception  of  public  records
requests, the persons handling requests generally
should  be  in-house  legal  counsel  for  those  insti-
tutions that have one, or a senior level manager or
compliance officer for those that do not.

The receiving office or person should have a basic
understanding of such requests:

•  The nature and kinds of records and

information that are maintained on campus
and that are likely to be requested.

•  The nature and structure of the institution’s
recordkeeping systems, including, but not
limited, to its IT systems.

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

•  The institution’s record retention policies and

other institutional policies

•  State and federal laws that govern the

maintenance and disclosure of records and
other information.

The  receiver  should  also  consider  developing  a
working  relationship  with  the  offices  of  the  law
enforcement agencies that are most likely to make
such  requests.  In  some  areas,  formal  structures
may already exist to facilitate such relationships.
One  such  example  is  InfraGard,  a  US  public-pri-
vate partnership association that promotes infor-
mation-sharing  and  reporting  between  compa-
nies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Establishing  such  relationships  in  advance  of
receiving a request for information should greatly
facilitate  the  response  and  provide  an  opportu-
nity to discuss legal and policy issues around law
enforcement access to data.

INTERNATIONAL DATA PRIVACY
LAWS AND REGULATIONS
The  notion  of  a  right  to  privacy  is  dramatically
different  across  geographies,  and  certain  coun-
tries  have  developed  aggressive  legislation  to
protect these cultural values.

In October 1998, the European Union’s Data Pro-
tection Directive went into effect to protect the
privacy  of  information  and  prohibit  the  trans-
fer  of  personal  data  to  non-European  Union
countries.  Some  non-EU  countries  are  thought
to  not  “adequately”  meet  EU  standards  for  pri-
vacy protection.

The  US  Department  of  Commerce,  in  consulta-
tion with the European Data Privacy Commission,
has developed a “Safe Harbor” framework to pro-
vide  a  means  for  US  companies  to  comply  with
the  EU  Data  Protection  Directive  via  the  US-EU
Safe Harbor program. In addition to applying for
safe  harbor  certification,  companies  have  also
found it effective to have internal groups and pol-

icies  that  strictly  address  data  privacy  and  the
transmission of electronically stored information
across borders.

The  Working  Group’s  recommendations,  which
are not binding on the privacy authorities of the
various EU countries, include the following:

CHAPTER 12 • CYBERSECURITY

Data privacy is a legal decision that must be care-
fully  analyzed  before  collecting  or  transferring
data  belonging  to  employees.  It  is  advisable  to
seek  the  advice  of  local  counsel  in  the  specific
country to provide guidance on compliance with
local regulations.

THE EU GENERAL DATA
PROTECTION REGULATION
The EU has a wide-ranging data privacy law that
has  been  implemented  by  individual  countries.
The  EU  data  privacy  law  extends  to  any  docu-
ment  containing  information  about  an  EU  cit-
izen,  and  it  governs  not  just  the  production  of
this information, but also how, where and under
what circumstances the information can be pro-
cessed and stored.

Under  EU  data  privacy  laws,  “personal  infor-
mation”  has  a  much  broader  definition  than  is
understood  in  the  US.  In  Europe  and  elsewhere,
personal information is virtually any information
about an individual, including name, physical and
email address, family members and similar facts
that can be used to identify someone, even if the
information  is  created  and  maintained  in  a  busi-
ness  environment.  EU  data  protection  laws  con-
trol the processing and transfer of data contain-
ing any personal information.

The  General  Data  Protection  Directive  (GDPR)
does  not  completely  prohibit  processing  and
transferring.  The  directive  has,  however,  been
interpreted to seek compliance with certain data
protection  requirements.  For  example,  in  Febru-
ary 2009, a Working Group established under the
Directive  published  “Working  Document  1/2009
on Pre-Trial Discovery for Cross Border Civil Liti-
gation,” which provides guidance in managing the
tension  between  US  litigation  discovery  obliga-
tions and the EU’s data protection requirements.

Consent.  Individuals  may  consent  to  the  pro-
cessing  of  their  personal  information.  Obtain-
ing consent, however, is no simple matter. To be
effective, consent must be given freely—it cannot
be  coerced,  even  mildly,  by  an  employer—vol-
untarily,  and  knowingly.  Evidence  of  consent
must  be  clear  and  consent,  once  given,  may  be
revoked.  Broad  advance  waivers  as  a  condition
of  employment  are  not  effective;  consent  must
be  provided  affirmatively  and  with  reference  to
the specific documents the production of which
has  been  requested.  Where  obtaining  consent
is not feasible, the party from whom documents
are  requested  must  at  least  disclose  to  affected
persons  that  their  personal  information  will  be
processed, and possibly disclosed, and offer such
persons the right to object.

Necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.
Processing  is  permitted  where  a  member  state
has  authorized  it  for  the  purposes  of  meeting  a
legal  obligation  to  comply  with  a  court  order  of
another jurisdiction regarding pre-trial discovery.

Necessary  for  meeting  a  legitimate  interest.
Processing and transferring personal information
data may be authorized to meet the demands of
litigation if accomplished in a measured, propor-
tionate and secure manner. Processing for litiga-
tion  requires  balancing  the  rights  of  the  individ-
uals  whose  personal  data  are  processed  against
the rights and interests of litigating parties.

PROTECTING THE DATA UNDER THE EU
DATA PROTECTION REGULATION
A party seeking to process personal data for liti-
gation must take numerous steps to protect per-
sonal  information.  As  much  processing  as  possi-
ble should be accomplished within the European
Union. The data must be anonymized or at least
pseudonymized, and must be culled of irrelevant
personal information. Truly sensitive information,

lowing  negotiations  with  the  European  Commis-
sion.  The  Department  of  Commerce  provides  a
process  of  self-certification  based  upon  adher-
ence  to  several  principles  pertaining  to  the  pro-
tection of personal data. These include:

•  Mechanisms for effective supervision of data
management with strong ongoing oversight

•  Limits on how data can be accessed and used

for purposes of US national security and
intelligence

•  The ability to field and respond to individual

complaints brought to a participating
organization within 45 days

•  Public declaration of commitment to the

Privacy Shield Framework

•  Informing individuals of their rights to

access their data, and informing individuals
what regulatory bodies have authority
over the organization’s compliance with
the Framework

such as official ID numbers, health and tax infor-
mation should be purged from the data. If the data
to  be  transferred  contains  personal  information,
the request to transfer it must be proportionate
to  the  legitimate  needs  of  the  case,  and  reason-
able provisions should be made to secure the data
and  to  prevent  its  use  and  transfer  beyond  the
matter at hand. Personal information must not be
indefinitely retained.

Penalties for violating privacy laws can be severe.
Private  parties  seeking  data  that  contains  per-
sonal information must be very familiar with the
laws  of  the  jurisdiction  hosting  the  data.  Even
data  created  in  the  work  environment  gener-
ally falls within the scope of the Data Protection
Regulation. For example, unlike what typically is
held  to  be  the  case  in  the  US,  email  created  in
the  work  environment  that  identifies  a  natural
person by name, address or context is considered
protected  personal  information  under  the  direc-
tive. Reports from committees that identify com-
mittee members may also be considered personal
information.

data  protected  by  the  GDPR  if  the  company  has

CHAPTER 12 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

Q 12-1. Your financial institution has been subject to several hacking attempts over the
last  few  weeks.  While  none  have  been  successful,  you  worry  that  it  might  be  a  matter
of  time.  To  keep  your  network  secure,  you  have  decided  to  update  your  network  secu-
rity policies.

What is an important step to include in your network security policy?

A.  Educate your online customers to detect phishing attempts and other fraudulent

email scams.

B.  Disable auto deletion of old data, including access logs, and move them to an

archive server.

C. Only permit administrative connections via the Internet through HTTPS or SSH

connections.

D. Require confirmation from network engineering before resetting any lost passwords.

See Answer and Rationales

Q 12-2. Your organization has a large online presence, providing all key services online.
You have recently found out that a hacker has gained access to your secure network, steal-
ing millions of customer usernames and passwords. You think the access was gained via
social engineering.

Your company’s success depends on your keeping this data secure, so your organization
wants to put procedures in place to ensure it can prevent any such further attacks. As an
initial step you have terminated Internet access for engineering and IT.

What would be the MOST effective further action for your firm to immediately take to pre-
vent this specific type of attack from happening again?

A.  Restrict external access on all routers and servers allowing administrative access only

from workstations in the engineering and IT departments.

B.  Staff should not be allowed to download any materials from the Internet or private

disks to the organization’s local drives.

C. Require all customers to change their passwords on a regular basis to access their

accounts and require strong passwords.

D. Upgrade all network firewalls and ensure they are running current software.

ETHICAL
RESPONSIBILITIES
AND
BEST
PRACTICES

OVERVIEW

Specialists  and  professionals  who  work  as  AML,  anti-corrup-

tion,  fraud  and  anti-sanctions  compliance  officers,  regulators,

enforcement  agents,  investigators,  prosecutors,  risk  officers

and other professionals in the global financial crime field have

one thing in common. They all face frequent tests of their ethics

264

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

.These  tests  may  arise  from  the  following  repre-
sentative examples:

•  A private banking client who applies pressure
to not file a required government report on
a transaction

•  A public official who asks that a suspicious
transaction be overlooked or obfuscated

•  A judge or regulator who insinuates that

an unlawful payment to him or her would
achieve the result you want

•  A customer who asks you to misstate the

facts about him so that he may be accepted
as a customer by your financial institution

•  A superior who asks you to ignore an internal
policy to facilitate an unlawful transaction he
is advocating

•  The temptation to sell or trade on

confidential information that comes to
you on the job

•  An employee who approaches you with
possible evidence of a financial crime
implicating a senior manager and asks you
to suppress it

•  A request to ignore an item in a profit and

loss statement that might show wrongdoing

ings of diverse players in the financial crime arena

occur. Because financial crime invariably involves
illicit proceeds, there are many opportunities for
temptation.  Many  financial  crime  specialists  in
the  public  and  private  sectors  have  been  lured
into wrongdoing when they confront the chance
to earn many times their salaries by conducting a
single transaction.

Financial criminals usually go to great effort and
expense  to  obtain  and  conceal  the  proceeds  of
their  crimes.  Often,  they  attempt  to  manipulate
or  corrupt  employees  of  financial  institutions
and  their  pursuers,  including  law  enforcement
agents,  regulators,  compliance  officers,  risk  offi-
cers, lawyers, financial institution executives and
others. Their goal is to frustrate the control and
compliance systems that have been built to com-
bat  them.  It  is  important  that  a  financial  crime
specialist remain on guard against ethical temp-
tations  and  violations.  This  can  mean  the  differ-
ence between a successful career and a situation
that results in losing your job and your freedom.

Financial  crime  professionals  work  in  many  dis-
ciplines.  Many  of  them,  such  as  attorneys  and
accountants,  must  adhere  to  codes  of  ethics
promulgated  by  their  professional  associations.
These  professionals  must  always  be  sensitive  to
these standards and the laws and regulations that
govern their conduct. The work of financial crime
specialists is closely tied to the law, but for them,
operating in a legal manner is not enough.

Ethics  go  beyond  obeying  the  law.  It  entails
adherence to a standard of conduct higher than
the minimum required by law. To become a Cer-
tified Financial Crime Specialist (CFCS), financial
crime  professionals  must  demonstrate  knowl-
edge  of  the  ethical  standards  that  govern  them
and  a  commitment  to  maintain  them.  The  work
of financial crime professionals should meet the
highest legal, ethical and professional standards.

This  chapter  covers  these  ethical  standards  and
addresses ethical issues faced by certain groups
of  specialists,  such  as  public  and  private  sector

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

investigators,  compliance  officers,  regulators,
attorneys and employees of financial institutions,
corporations and other business entities.

CODES OF CONDUCT
Apart  from  the  routine  “right  or  wrong”  deci-
sions  that  financial  crime  specialists  must  make
each  day,  preventing,  detecting  and  combating
financial crime often offers a dimension of moral
ambiguity that is difficult to define. This is where
a  strong  code  of  conduct  issued  by  the  organi-
zation where the financial crime specialist works
helps  guide  the  employees.  However,  a  code  of
conduct  is  only  as  good  as  the  supervision  and
enforcement  it  receives  from  the  organization
that issued it.

No private- or public-sector organization should
operate  without  a  written  code  of  conduct.
Employees  of  all  ranks  should  receive  it  and  be
required  to  read  and  sign  it.  The  signed  copy
should be placed in the employee’s personnel file.

It is also advisable to maintain a mandatory “con-
flict of interest” reporting regimen for all employ-
ees.  Among  other  things,  the  employees  should
be required to report gifts, potentially conflictive
personal relationships with outsiders, potentially
conflictive  jobs  held  by  family  members  and  the
like.  Improper  requests  or  communications  by
present  or  prospective  customers  or  outsiders
should also be reported by the employees.

When  dealing  with  conflicts  of  interests  among
several  clients,  a  Certified  Financial  Crime  Spe-
cialist  should  consult  the  clients  to  resolve  the
issues in a way that is acceptable to all.

A guiding principle in resolving conflicts of inter-
est should be the fair and equal treatment of the
clients. In these situations, one client should not
receive preferential treatment over another, such
as in deciding which client should have an invest-
ment  opportunity  or  a  financial  crime  investiga-

tor deciding where to focus an investigation and
other similar situations.

If a fair resolution cannot be found, the financial
crime specialist should not continue favoring one
client over another.

 WHAT ARE ETHICS?
The  dictionary  defines  ethics  as,  “The  discipline
of dealing with what is good and bad; and with a
moral duty and obligation.”

Ethics consists of the principles that guide us in
deciding what is right and wrong. It establishes a
sense of duty and obligation -- what we expect of
ourselves and of others in any given situation.

Ethics  describes  standard  of  behavior.  It  is  dif-
ferent  than  obeying  the  law  because  the  law
prescribes  what  we  may  do  without  incurring
a  penalty  and  what  the  penalties  are  if  we  don’t
follow it. Ethics, on the other hand, provides the
framework  for  how  we  make  decisions  and  how
we determine our course of action.

MAKING ETHICAL DECISIONS
Making  sound  decisions  requires  awareness  of
ethical  issues  and  a  process  for  considering  the
ethical aspects of these decisions. The more diffi-
cult an ethical choice is, the more important it is
to communicate with others about the dilemmas
that are before us.

By seeking the guidance of someone else, we are
better positioned to make sound ethical choices.
On the other hand, an old adage on ethics says, “If
you have to ask about it, it’s probably wrong.”

Ethical  decision-making  should  include  the  fol-
lowing steps:

Identify  the  issues—It  is  important  to  mentally
identify  issues  that  present  a  real  or  potential
ethical  dilemma,  and  to  understand  how  one’s
actions affect others. We must weigh the expec-

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

266

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

tations of others about our conduct and how they
may affect us. It is difficult to act ethically if we
don’t recognize issues as they arise.

Get  the  facts—Obtain  as  much  information  as
possible  to  illuminate  the  situation  and  obtain
specific,  objective  information.  One  must  take  a
broad  view  even  when  only  partial  information
is available. One must consider how to find other
pertinent  information.  Consider  the  motivation
some  persons  may  have  in  supplying  partial  or
incorrect information.

Consider  alternative  courses  of  action —In
resolving  ethical  dilemmas,  one  must  take  a
broad  approach,  consider  other  alternatives  and
how  others  will  view  our  actions.  One  should
decide  which  principles  apply  to  a  situation  and
prioritize them. One should consider the rights of
other stakeholders, treat people fairly and act in
the best interests of the affected persons.

Consider  professional  standards—Many  pro-
fessional  organizations  issue  written  codes  of
the  standards  of  conduct,  which  provide  a  good
measure  and  test  of  possible  courses  of  action.
Experienced colleagues or supervisors may offer
valuable  guidance  in  resolving  ethical  dilemmas.
They may present other issues, share a new per-
spective or identify areas that one was not view-
ing objectively.

Make  a  decision —It  is  advisable  to  choose  the
best  option  to  resolve  a  particular  situation.  Act
decisively and implement your plan even though
this is sometimes difficult.

Act  and  assess—It  is  a  good  practice  to  assess
one’s actions and weigh whether they achieve the
desired  result.  It  is  never  wrong  to  ask  yourself,
“Am  I  doing  the  right  thing?  Would  an  indepen-
dent person think that this action is correct and
fair? How would I react if this were done to me?”

When instituting conflict of interest rules for an
organization, do the following:

•  Develop a systematic and objective approach

for screening new clients or selecting
cases to pursue or embarking on any task
where objectivity and ethical standards
may be tested.

•  If possible, select a colleague who is

not affiliated with the matter to screen
the relevant facts and the persons in a
particular situation.

•  Designate a conflict of interest officer for

your organization or unit.

UNDERSTANDING THE RESPECTIVE
ROLES IN YOUR ORGANIZATION
Two  of  the  most  important  principles  that  gov-
ern  the  conduct  of  a  financial  crime  specialist
are  to  constantly  remember  the  rights,  well-be-
ing  and  obligations  of  one’s  organization  and  to
honor these factors. One owes a duty of honesty
and diligence to one’s organization, along with its
mission and constituency.

The  work  of  every  financial  crime  specialist
can  involves  potential  conflicts  of  interest  that
threaten  these  interests.  They  must  be  recog-
nized and resolved ethically.

INFORM THE ORGANIZATION AND CLIENTS
OF SCOPE AND COST OF PROJECTS
Financial  crime  specialists  are  sometimes
engaged  by  clients  or  their  organizations  for  a
specified  project,  such  as  representing  a  person
or organization that is under investigation for for-
eign  corrupt  practices,  fraud,  money  laundering
or violation of the sanctions laws and regulations.
The  clients  or  organization  should  be  informed
of the likelihood of certain outcomes so they can
make informed decisions on the scope of the work,
the projected fees and costs, and the risk of rep-
utational harm and other negative consequences.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

267

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

The  briefing  of  an  organization’s  superiors  or
clients  has  two  requirements.  First,  they  must
be  thoroughly  informed  at  the  outset  about  the
full nature of the project, including the good and
bad aspects.

Second,  they  must  be  informed  regularly  about
the progress and the actual and future costs. This
applies to employees of government agencies who
have a choice of moving forward on two matters
where resources permit embarking on only one.

The financial crime specialist should offer a proj-
ect plan and budget to the client or organization
that identifies the significant steps that must be
taken and the expected costs of each stage.

When  preparing  this  plan  and  budget,  the  finan-
cial crime specialist is in a better position to iden-
tify the stages and expected costs. Thus, specialist
should always be accurate in estimating expected
time frames and costs and avoid the temptation
to  provide  unrealistically  low  estimates  in  order
to  secure  authorization,  or  to  continue  a  matter
that he or she knows is unpromising.

COMMUNICATING WITH CLIENTS
Financial  crime  specialists  should  also  maintain
open lines of communication with their superiors,
clients or constituents to inform them of ongoing
developments. The duty to educate them contin-
ues throughout the course of the matter. Special-
ists may find it necessary to communicate beyond
routine updates, such as in these scenarios:

•  Before undertaking any action that may

require informed consent by the organization
or an individual

•  Notifying clients or superiors when a

requested action is limited or prohibited by
law or regulation

UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES OF MEMBERS
OF AN ORGANIZATION
A financial crime specialist also must understand
the  division  of  roles  and  responsibilities  in  an

organization. This should be clear to everyone in
the  organization  so  they  may  make  appropriate
decisions  and  understand  the  actions  they  may
take without obtaining approval.

In  financial  crime  matters,  everyone  should
understand  the  objectives  of  particular  projects
and participate, as appropriate, in deciding on the
areas of focus, the budgets and desired outcomes.

In  appropriate  circumstances  in  the  private  sec-
tor, it is prudent to use an engagement letter to
describe the nature of the work that the specialist
is expected to undertake, the limitations imposed
by  the  client,  and  a  clear  description  of  the  pro-
jected fees and costs.

The  financial  crime  specialist,  including  clients
and  superiors,  should  recognize  that  the  objec-
tives of the project may change over time as more
information  is  gathered.  It  is  advisable  to  main-
tain a continuing dialogue to refine the objectives
and  other  elements  of  the  project  and  to  docu-
ment the decisions in writing.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
In  the  private  and  public  sectors,  the  work  of  a
financial  crime  specialist  often  raises  poten-
tial conflicts of interest. They can be difficult to
resolve. A specialist must be sensitive to different
situations that can create these conflicts. Policies
should  be  implemented  by  the  organization  to
avoid  or  mitigate  conflicts  and  their  effects  and
resolve them.

The  financial  crime  specialist  must  remain  alert
to potential conflicts of interest. One type of con-
flict that is inherent in the nature of most engage-
ments,  including  those  in  the  private  sector,  is
the desire to earn fees from the client or others.
Work that generates fees should not be prolonged
in order to continue the payment of fees. Clients
should be informed promptly at significant points
where  a  more  economical  approach  is  possible
and not harmful.

268

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

Similar situations exist in the public sector where
a  government  operation  may  be  prolonged  for
improper  motives.  Financial  crime  specialists  at
government agencies must always remember that
their resources, including their salaries, are paid
by  the  taxpayers,  who  are  owed  the  same  hon-
est dealings and conduct as are clients of private
sector specialists.

Financial  institution  and  corporate  regulators
often  have  rules  or  guidelines  that  govern  how
the regulated entities should manage and prevent
conflicts  of  interests.  Most  countries  prohibit
conduct  that  arises  from  conflicts  of  interest,
such  as  insider  trading  or  self-dealing.  Conflicts
of interest can easily elevate from an ethical vio-
lation to a financial crime.

Some conflicts of interest are so significant they
compel a decision to decline to undertake a mat-
ter or to withdraw from an existing one. In other
situations, conflicts may be managed by adopting
protective  measures,  such  as  obtaining  written
waivers  from  one’s  superiors  or  clients,  disclos-
ing  potential  conflicts  to  superiors  or  clients  or
blocking  access  to  documents  and  other  things
to  prevent  people  and  information  from  a  dif-
ferent  case  from  contaminating  or  affecting  a
current matter.

UNDERSTANDING & RESOLVING
CONFLICTS AT DISTINCT PRIVATE AND
PUBLIC ENTITIES
Everyone  who  works  in  the  financial  crime  field
has  the  obligation  to  place  the  interests  of  their
organization,  customers,  constituents  and  other
stakeholders  above  their  own.  Employees  of
financial  institutions  in  the  broad  sense  of  the
term, in particular, must recognize the purposes
for  which  accounts,  relationships  or  trusts  they
manage  and  oversee  were  created,  and  adminis-
ter them accordingly.

Institutions  and  commercial  corporations  must
also ensure that their customers are treated hon-
estly, fairly and equitably, and that their employ-
ees  are  not  extending  undue  privileges  and  ben-
efits,  intentionally  or  unintentionally,  to  some
customers over others.

Conflicts  of
in  transac-
interest  may  arise
tions  or  dealings  involving  insider  or  privileged
information.

In  other  situations,  a  situation  that  begins  as  a
failure  of  internal  controls  and  insensitivity  to
ethical obligations can become a financial crime
which  brings  severe  financial  consequences  to
innocent  individuals  and  organizations,  includ-
ing reputational harm, governmental penalties or
prosecution and lawsuits by the victims.

INFORMATION BARRIERS
Information  barriers  or  “firewalls”  can  provide
strong protection against conflicts of interest at
private-  and  public-sector  entities.  These  barri-
ers are intended to limit the flow of information
between  internal  units  and  persons.  They  are
designed  to  allow  employees  of  an  organization
to  advance  their  legitimate  activities  without
exposure to information that may produce a con-
flict of interest.

 Information  barriers  at  private-  and  public-sec-
tor  organizations  may  take  various  forms  based
on  the  size  and  services  the  organization  pro-
vides. They can be physical barriers, such as the
physical  separation  of  units  of  employees  in  the
blocking of access to certain information by elec-
tronic means.

Information barriers should also include policies
and  procedures  that  explain  problems  that  may
be  encountered,  how  to  resolve  them  and  how
to  apply  the  organization’s  policies.  Some  com-
mon  controls  on  conflicts  of  interest  at  private-
and  public-sector  organizations  may  include
the following:

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

269

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

•  Assessing the services, activities, functions
and distinct types of employees to identify
where conflicts of interest may arise

•  Restricting employee access to information
through a system of multi-tiered access
rights or similar limitations

•  Written conflict of interest policies that
clearly outline prohibited behavior and
provide guidance, instructions and examples
on avoiding conflicts of interest

•  Training programs that teach awareness of
and sensitivity to conflicts of interest and
their ethical resolution

•  Secure methods to record and preserve
relevant information at the start of an
operation or a customer and business
relationship to identify and manage
conflicts of interest

•  Clear policies and instructions that govern
disclosure to the appropriate government
authorities of internal lapses in honest and
proper conduct by the organization and
its employees

ETHICAL ISSUES IN ONBOARDING AND
MONITORING CUSTOMERS
Financial  crime  specialists  who  work  in  com-
pliance  and  risk  management  sometimes  have
latitude  in  the  onboarding  and  monitoring  of
customers  and  customer  activity.  The  ethical
considerations  for  persons  who  onboard  and
monitor customers are similar to those that can
be used to resolve conflicts of interest.

When  deciding  whether  to  onboard  a  customer
and monitor customer activity, a financial crime
specialist must follow the policies and procedures
of  the  organization.  Compliance  officers  and
other  employees  should  not  subject  a  customer
to enhanced due diligence procedures, for exam-
ple,  because  of  a  personal  bias  against  the  cus-
tomer or a “feeling” without supporting evidence.

Similarly, decisions to not follow certain onboard-
ing  or  monitoring  procedures  should,  of  course,
not be based on an expectation of financial gain
offered  by  the  customer,  or  bonuses  or  other
benefits from the organization for onboarding or
monitoring a customer.

Financial crime specialists, including compliance
and risk management specialists, frequently have
access  to  a  customer’s  personal  information.  A
specialist  must  securely  store  and  manage  cus-
tomer  information  and  access  and  retain  if  it  is
necessary for onboarding and monitoring and as
required by law or regulations. The Data Security
and  Privacy  chapter  of  this  manual  cover  other
considerations  in  the  handling  of  customer  and
other sensitive information.

BUILDING CONFLICT OF
INTEREST POLICIES
When  not  properly  managed,  conflicts  of  inter-
est  can  be  a  source  of  serious  repercussions
and  consequences.  To  manage  conflicts  effec-
tively,  business  and  government  organizations
must have thoughtful and sound written policies
and procedures.

The  key  part  of  a  sound  process  is  the  ability
to  identify  all  the  parties  involved  in  any  case,
an  account,  business  transaction  or  matter.  By
knowing  who  is  involved,  potential  conflicts  are
more readily identified.

larger  organizations,

At
identifying  conflicts
can  be  complicated.  All  relationships  and  con-
flicts may not be readily apparent. Poor internal
communications  can  allow  conflicts  to  go  unde-
tected. Staff turnover also increases risk levels by
increasing the loss of institutional knowledge.

In  conflict  management,  the  staff  and  their  rela-
tives and business and personal connections are
an important consideration. A conflict of interest
policy  should  alert  pertinent  units  of  an  organi-
zation  to  possible  conflicts  in  distinct  types  of
relationships.  Developing  and  implementing  a

270

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

system to capture and retrieve employee and cli-
ent  information  is  essential  to  identify  potential
conflicts of interest.

Employee  privacy  and  an  organization’s  needs
require  a  delicate  balance.  Confidential  informa-
tion  about  an  organization’s  employees  must  be
safeguarded  and  kept  private.  The  reasons  for
determining  that  a  conflict  of  interest  existed
should  not  be  shared  with  other  staff  members,
customers  or  clients,  unless  it  is  compelling  or
there is an official reason to do so.

Some  organizations  require  a  committee  to
review  confidential  information  to  decide  what
should be placed in a conflict of interest database.
Having  a  well-defined  protocol  for  this  process
is  important  to  ensure  uniformity  and  fairness.
Information  concerning  employees,  their  rela-
tives  and  private  dealings  should  be  deleted  or
stored  separately  and  securely  when  an  employ-
ment relationship ends.

Other  guidance  that  should  be  included  in  an
organization’s conflict of interest policies include
the following:

•  The relationships of directors, officers and
other officials with outside organizations

•  The extension to employees of free or

discounted services from the organization as
fringe benefits

•  The names of all employees who receive

gifts or entertainment benefits from outside
persons, businesses, customers or vendors

This data from new engagements or relationships
should  be  added  to  the  conflict  system  or  data-
base as soon as they commence or are identified.
Failure  to  manage  and  update  these  systems  in
a  timely  manner  may  result  in  loss  of  business,
harm to reputation and potential legal liability.

All  employees  at  all  levels  should  be  required  to
know  and  receive  proper  training  on  internal

conflict  of  interest  and  ethics  policies  and  the
organization’s expectations and procedures.

PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS
Investigations  in  the  public  and  private  sectors
often present financial crime specialists with dif-
ficult  ethical  decisions.  For  example,  one  of  the
more  difficult  issues  that  investigators  confront
are  the  privacy  rights  of  investigative  subjects,
including  their  inclusion  in  databases  that  are
accessible by many persons, sometimes even out-
side the organization.

With  the  pervasive  use  of  technology,  violating
the  privacy  rights  of  a  subject,  customer  or  col-
league  is  easy.  It  may  be  tempting  to  surrepti-
tiously access a person’s computer, place cameras
to  monitor  a  subject,  enter  a  subject’s  property
to place tracking devices on their vehicles, or tap
a  telephone  without  court  authorization.  These
are steps that can ruin the careers of a financial
crime specialist.

It  is  ethically  questionable  or  even  illegal  for  a
financial  crime  specialist  or  others  to  misrepre-
sent  themselves  in  order  to  obtain  personal  or
financial  information  about  a  subject,  customer,
client, opponent in a legal matter, or others. Pos-
ing as an employer to obtain a credit report, for
example, is a crime in some jurisdictions.

Whether an action is an unlawful invasion of pri-
vacy or is a legitimate investigative step depends
on  the  laws  where  the  action  occurs.  Financial
crime specialists should know the applicable laws
and regulations in jurisdictions where they work
or  where  they  seek  information.  They  should
remember  that  what  is  legal  in  one  jurisdiction
may not be legal in another.

Bending  the  rules  in  a  due  diligence  procedure
performed at a financial institution or other busi-
ness may do significant harm, in addition to con-
stituting  an  ethical  violation.  It  may  also  jeopar-
dize a case or other matter and cause reputational

271

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

harm  to  the  individual  and  the  organization.  In
most
jurisdictions,  records  that  are  illegally
obtained  are  inadmissible  as  evidence  in  court
and  may  lead  to  the  dismissal  or  discharge  of
legal proceedings against the target, and expose
the organization and individuals to legal liability.

To  avoid  these  consequences,  financial  crime
specialists should understand the applicable laws
and regulations. The guidance of an attorney to
resolve unclear areas and doubts about the legal-
ity of a contemplated action should be sought.

CONFLICTS IN THE INTERACTION OF
INVESTIGATIVE TARGETS AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS
It is not uncommon for a financial crime specialist
to interact with the subjects or targets of a case or
investigation. These persons may make improper
requests, such as to ignore or not disclose certain
information,  and  may  also  offer  unlawful  com-
pensation to look the other way.

Any  agreement  to  such  a  request  is  a  betrayal
of  the  duty  to  the  organization.  Such  offers  or
requests  should  be  reported  immediately  to  the
appropriate  superiors,  including  internal  affairs
officers, because they may amount to attempted
bribery  or  extortion  that  should  be  reported  to
law enforcement authorities.

If  there  is  a  duty  to  notify  law  enforcement
authorities, legal counsel should be consulted to
assure  obedience  with  applicable  laws  and  reg-
ulations. Because of the harm that may result to
innocent  parties,  everything  reasonable  should
be done to verify the credibility of the allegations.

FORMER AND CURRENT CLIENTS
AND COLLEAGUES
A  financial  crime  specialist  may  encounter  con-
flicts  from  work  that  he  or  she  has  previously
performed, such as when a new matter is opened
that  involves  persons  with  connections  to  prior
work done by the specialist or the organization.

A  potential  conflict  also  arises  when  a  new case
will  be  affected  by  confidential  information  the
specialist  learned  in  an  unrelated  situation.  Pos-
session  of  this  information  could  result  in  prej-
udice  to  the  prior  client  and  affect  one’s  ability
to  fulfill  the  full  obligations  with  the  new  client.
Similar  conflicts  may  arise  for  specialists  who
work in government agencies.

The first step a financial crime specialist should
take  when  a  new  matter  arrives  is  to  conduct  a
“conflict  of  interest  check.”  This  involves  com-
paring the names of all persons and entities that
were  associated  with  a  prior  matter  with  those
involved in the new matter. The names of persons
and entities that are connected to the new client
or  matter  should  also  be  checked  against  those
in prior matters. This process requires a current
list of all persons, organizations and clients with
whom  the  financial  crime  specialist  or  the  orga-
nization had prior dealings.

The  second  recommended  step  is  to  determine
overlaps  in  the  work  done  in  the  past,  and  the
anticipated work in the new matter. When a name
associated with a new matter is the same as one
in  a  prior  matter,  attention  should  be  paid  to
determine if a conflict exists. If a financial crime
specialist is asked to take action against a former
client, this poses a significant conflict of interest
and the specialist should decline the matter.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

272

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

The  third  step  is  to  establish  procedures  that
assure  that  an  overlap  in  names  does  not  preju-
dice past or prospective clients. The greater the
overlap, the greater the actions a financial crime
specialist  should  take  to  prevent  harm  to  the
organization, matter or present or past clients.

The  following  actions  may  be  taken  to  prevent
harm when potential conflicts of interest arise:

•  Promptly disclosing to past or present
colleagues, clients or organizations the
nature of a potential conflict of interest

•  Asking these persons and organizations to

waive conflicts of interest that may exist, if it
is appropriate

•  Creating a wall or other safeguards to ensure
that persons who were involved with a prior
matter will not see or have access to files of
the new matter and will not participate in it

•  Declining to accept the prospective

matter or case

Sometimes  a  conflict  of  interest  cannot  be
avoided  in  advance  because  its  existence  is  not
known  until  a  later  stage.  When  conflicts  are
discovered  later,  a  complete,  prompt  disclosure
to  all  affected  parties  must  be  made.  In  most
cases, skilled financial crime specialists can work
with  the  affected  persons  to  reach  an  accept-
able resolution.

If  a  resolution  cannot  be  found,  the  specialist
should not continue to work in a situation where
one client may be favored over another.

In government matters, similar conflicts to those
in  the  private  sector  may  arise.  A  government
financial  crime  specialist  should  never  compro-
mise a proper action in order to obtain an advan-
tage in a present matter, unless a well-considered
decision favoring a concession is justified. A plea
bargain,  coupled  with  other  inducements  that
government agents may offer to a target or infor-
mants in a financial crime matter, is an example
of such a compromise.

CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND THE
FINANCIAL CRIME SPECIALIST
Many  conflicts  may  arise  between  a  financial
crime  specialist  and  his  or  her  colleagues  or  cli-
ents. Some are inherent in work performed for a
fee. Procedures should exist that ensure that all
work  billed  to  a  client  is  honestly  and  fairly  per-
formed. A financial crime specialist has a respon-
sibility to the organization, colleagues and clients
to assure that work performed is authorized and
reasonably  crafted  to  accomplish  the  ultimate
goal set by the organization.

Some  conflicts  arise  from  disagreements  over
fees or difficulties of an organization or client to
find an operation. An example is when a financial
crime asset recovery specialist has agreed to pro-
vide services on a contingent basis with the fees
to  be  paid  from  a  client’s  winnings.  If  the  client
becomes unable to continue funding the case, the
specialist faces the prospect of losing an opportu-
nity to collect a good contingency fee and may be
tempted to propose improper funding of the case.
These conflicts should be addressed quickly and
discussed in the initial engagement agreement.

Conflicts  may  arise  for  non-financial  reasons,
such as when a superior or client imposes limita-
tions  that  the  financial  crime  specialist  believes
are  unreasonable.  A  client  may  insist  that  the
financial  crime  specialist  focus  on  a  target  that
the specialist believes has little value to the case,
for example. Or, when a superior or a client may
ask the financial crime specialist to engage in ille-
gal  or  unethical  conduct.  These  problems  must
be confronted directly and discussed with appro-
priate persons in the organization. The financial
crime  specialist  should  document  all  pertinent
actions discussed and taken.

PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF THE
ORGANIZATION OR CLIENT
A financial crime specialist should assure that he
or she is not engaging in conduct that may harm
his organization or client. It is a good idea to fol-
low  the  medical  field’s  Hippocratic  Oath,  “First,

273

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 13 • ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES

do no harm.” Financial crime specialists perform
a  valuable  service  when  they  advise  their  orga-
nizations,  colleagues  or  clients  that  the  actions
they  are  suggesting  may  be  unproductive,  coun-
terproductive,  harmful,  improper  or  unethical.
Examples include the following:

•  Pursuing a civil action where the costs
are expected to exceed the value of the
successful outcome or recovery

•  Engaging in conduct likely to be offensive
to a court and result in sanctions or other
negative consequences to the client and the
financial crime specialist

•  Undertaking actions that will likely

cause embarrassment or harm to an
organization or client

This was illustrated in the mid-2000s when a For-
tune 500 company hired private investigators to
identify the source of leaks of confidential board
of  director  information  to  the  media.  The  inves-
tigators used deceptive telephone calls to obtain
banking and phone records of suspected persons.
When  the  scheme  was  discovered,  the  company
and several officers became the subjects of crim-
inal investigations. The company paid a large fine
and several officers were fired.

By  its  very  nature,  financial  crime  is  full  of  cir-
cumstances  that  may  harm  or  destroy  the  repu-
tations of persons. Being mindful and respectful
of  the  ethical  obligations  that  a  specialist  car-
ries  as  part  of  the  job  is  an  essential  part  of  all
financial  crime  positions  and  a  crucial  element
of the Certified Financial Crime Specialist (CFCS)
certification.

INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENTS
AND
STANDARDS

OVERVIEW

From the local to the global, efforts to detect and prevent finan-

cial crime occur on many levels. As discussed in previous chap-

ters of this Manual, financial crime is a global plague that takes

place across borders and throughout the national and interna-

tional financial systems. That is why financial crime must also

be addressed on the international level.

276

CHAPTER 14 • INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND STANDARDS

This  has  long  been  recognized  by  governments
and  their  enforcement  and  regulatory  agencies.
Through treaties, interagency arrangements and
international  organizations,  governments  world-
wide have sought for decades to build cooperation
concerning standards and procedures for policy,
regulation and enforcement concerning financial
crime. These efforts were spearheaded by North
American and European nations in the past, but,
in  recent  years,  many  developing  nations  have
played a significant role.

Developing  consensus  around  best  practices  in
financial  crime  control  has  not  been  limited  to
the public sector. Private sector groups, particu-
larly in banking and financial services sectors, are
increasingly active in setting international guide-
lines on compliance, ranging from your customer
procedures  to  due  diligence  procedures  for  cus-
tomers and third parties.

Most recently, nonprofit organizations and advo-
cacy  groups  have  also  established  a  major  pres-
ence  on  the  international  level.  Groups  such  as
Transparency
International,  Global  Financial
Integrity, Human Rights Watch, and others have
used lobbying and media campaigns to pressure
governments,  financial  institutions  and  other
corporations to act on important financial crime
issues  ranging  from  corruption  and  tax  evasion
to secrecy havens.

Taken  together,  there  is  a  clear  trend  toward
greater  international  cooperation  and  coordina-
tion  on  financial  crime  issues  in  the  public  and
private sectors. New initiatives such as the US For-
eign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (FATCA)
have accelerated this trend. Therefore, a financial
crime specialist should know the principal actors
and standards in the international arena.

There  is  no  scarcity  of  international  standards,
conventions  and  organizations  that  establish
standards  of  proper  conduct  in  dealing  with
financial  crime.  The  great  limitation  on  their
effectiveness is that these norms are not self-ex-

ecuting  and  require  the  political  will  and  com-
mitment to implement them by laws, regulations
and enforcement.

This chapter will highlight the noteworthy inter-
national standards and the organizations behind
them.  In  many  cases,  the  standards  and  agree-
ments  are  only  summarized  briefly.  When  doc-
uments  or  recommendations  are  referenced  by
name,  the  financial  crime  professional  should
consult  these  sources.  Links  are  provided
throughout the chapter and in the Appendix.

UNITED NATIONS
The  United  Nations  is  the  most  visible  interna-
tional body with 193 member nations. The nations
act similarly to a global legislative body, voting on
a wide variety of policies and resolutions, which
are  then  are  supposed  to  be  implemented  by
member  countries.  Many  measures  enacted  by
the  UN  are  not  legally  binding,  and  are  seen  as
mainly symbolic.

The  UN  can  also  propose  multilateral  trea-
ties,  known  as  conventions,  which  bind  member
nations  to  adopt  legislative  measures  or  regula-
tory  policies  to  implement  them.  While  imple-
mentation often varies widely among UN member
states, conventions can be powerful tools to drive
policy changes internationally.

One  convention  with  significant  effect  in  the
financial  crime  field  is  the  United  Nations  Con-
vention Against Corruption, which is discussed in
the Global Anti-Corruption chapter.

Another  important  international  agreement  that
originated with the UN is the United Nations Con-
vention  Against  Transnational  Organized  Crime.
This  convention  was  adopted  in  2000  and  has
been  ratified  by  more  than  175  member  nations.
Generally,  it  commits  signatories  to  adopt  laws
and enforcement mechanisms to combat human
trafficking,  migrant  smuggling  and  arms  traf-
ficking.  Some  of  the  measures  required  by  the

277

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 14 • INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND STANDARDS

convention  include  money  laundering  and  asset
forfeiture laws to seize criminal proceeds. Signa-
tories  to  the  convention  are  monitored  for  com-
pliance  with  the  treaty’s  provisions  by  panels  of
UN-appointed experts under the direction of the
UN Office on Drugs and Crime.

The United Nations also issues sanctions against
countries  that  are  deemed  to  be  violating  inter-
national  principles.  The  sanctions  impose  prohi-
bitions  on  commerce  and  financial  transactions
with the sanctioned countries.

UN  sanctions  originate  with  the  UN  Security
Council  and  commit  UN  member  states  that
adopt  them  to  comply  with  the  limitations  on
trade and transactions. These sanctions are simi-
lar to those imposed by the US Treasury Depart-
ment’s  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  (OFAC)
and other nations. They typically include a list of
sanctioned entities, agencies or individuals. In the
case  of  sanctions  limiting  financial  transactions,
they usually require the blocking of transactions
to or from the sanctioned entity and the placing
of the funds in an interest-bearing account. They
do not require countries to detain or arrest per-
sons or entities that are listed in sanctions lists.

UN sanctions are sometimes used to deter coun-
tries  from  taking  aggressive  military  action
against  other  countries,  or  to  punish  coun-
tries that do so.

FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE
The  Financial  Action  Task  Force,  or  FATF,  was
formed  in  1989  by  the  G-7  nations,  which  then
were  Canada,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Japan,
United Kingdom and the US. Since then, the FATF
has evolved into the principal standard-setter of
global  anti-money  laundering  controls  and  poli-
cies  for  nations,  financial  institutions  and  other
private  sector  organizations.  The  first  formal
action  of  the  FATF  in  April  1990  was  to  promul-
gate  the  “40  Recommendations,”  which  recom-
mend conduct by government agencies, financial

institutions  and  other  organizations  to  combat
money laundering.

The  FATF’s  stated  purpose  is  to  develop  policies
to  control  and  prevent  money  laundering  and
terrorist  financing.  Over  the  years,  the  FATF  40
Recommendations  have  been  revised  to  reflect
the  changing  financial  crime  landscape.  Before
the most recent amendments in 2012, the FATF 40
Recommendations were revised in 1996, 2001 and
2003. After the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001,  (9/11)  the  FATF  issued  nine  special  recom-
mendations aimed at the financing of terrorism.

In early 2012, the FATF took its biggest step away
from a strict focus on money laundering. It began
to  emphasize  the  importance  of  targeting  cor-
ruption  and  tax  evasion,  which  are  intertwined
with  money  laundering.  Thus,  the  FATF’s  recom-
mendations  seem  to  be  taking  the  same  route
toward financial crime “convergence” that finan-
cial institutions and government agencies around
the  world  are  pursuing.  (See  Appendix  for  the
FATF 40 Recommendations of 2012.)

As of early 2018, The FATF had 37 members, con-
sisting of 35 jurisdictions and two regional orga-
nizations  (the  Gulf  Cooperation  Council  and  the
European Commission).

The  FATF  also  has  a  global  network  of  so-called
FATF-Style  Regional  Bodies  (FSRBs)  that  follow
their  own,  albeit  compatible,  programs  and  pol-
icies.  These  bodies  promote  implementation  of
the FATF 40 Recommendations by their members
and  advise  FATF  on  regional  issues  and  condi-
tions. There are eight regional FSRBs.

The FATF is strictly a policy-making body without
enforcement  authority.  To  drive  implementation
of  its  policies  and  recommendations,  the  FATF
organizes  programs  of  mutual  assessments  of
nations. In an FATF mutual assessment, a nation
submits  to  a  review  by  teams  of  experts  from
other  countries,  who  gauge  the  nation’s  prog-

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

278

CHAPTER 14 • INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND STANDARDS

ress  toward  full  implementation  of  the  40  Rec-
ommendations.

This  assessment  may  lead  to  public  exposure
of  deficiencies  in  money  laundering  and  finan-
cial  crime  policies  and  enforcement.  This  expo-
sure  and  the  potential  political  embarrassment
and  public  outcry  that  may  follow  exerts  pres-
sure  on  nations  to  comply  with  the  FATF’s  Rec-
ommendations.

Additionally,  since  2000,  the  FATF  has  published
a  so-called  “blacklist”  of  nations  that  refuse  to
follow  the  FATF  Recommendations  or  to  comply
with  its  international  standards  on  money  laun-
dering  and  financial  crime  enforcement.  The
blacklist  proved  to  be  so  effective  that  all  coun-
tries  were  removed  by  2008,  although  the  FATF
still publishes a semi-annual list of “high- risk and
non-cooperative” countries.

40 RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL
ACTION TASK FORCE
The  40  Recommendations  can  be  found  at  the
FATF  website,  www.fatf-gafi.org.  They  are  listed
in  seven  broad  categories  and  focus  on  pol-
icy  measures  for  nations  and  best  practices  for
financial  crime  controls  at  financial  institutions
and corporations.

Although  primarily  focused  on  money  launder-
ing and terrorist financing, the FATF Recommen-
dations  have  increasingly  branched  out  to  cover
financial  crime  as  a  whole.  The  2012  version  of
the recommendations, for example, included pro-
visions  directing  countries  to  make  tax  crimes
predicate  offenses  for  money  laundering  cases
and  calling  for  enhanced  scrutiny  of  political-
ly-exposed persons (PEPs) to combat corruption.

The  40  Recommendations  apply  directly  to
compliance  professionals.  Many  of  the  Recom-
mendations  have  been  widely  implemented  as
key  elements  of  compliance  programs  at  finan-
cial  institutions  worldwide.  Because  of  their
importance  and  broad  acceptance  as  a  global

anti-money  laundering  baseline,  financial  crime
specialists should read the full text of the 40 Rec-
ommendations,  available  at  http://www.fatf-gafi.

ORGANIZATION FOR
ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND
DEVELOPMENT (OECD)
One  of  the  older  and  more  influential  intergov-
ernmental bodies, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD),  has  the
mission  to  promote  policies  that  improve  eco-
nomic  and  social  conditions  worldwide.  The
OECD  was  created  in  September  1961  and  pres-
ently has 34 member nations.

The  OECD
four main areas:

concentrates

its

efforts

in

1.  The restoration of confidence in markets and
the institutions and companies that make
them function, including improved regulation
and more effective governance at all levels of
political and business life

2.  The restoration of public finance as a basis

for future economic growth

3.  Support for new sources of growth through
innovation, environmentally friendly ‘green
growth’ strategies and development of
emerging economies

4.  To foster innovation and growth, ensuring
that people of all ages develop the skills to
work productively and satisfactorily in the
jobs of tomorrow

The OECD has three components: Council, Com-
mittees and Secretariat. The Council is the over-
all decision maker and has at least one represent-
ative  per  member  country  and  a  representative
of  the  European  Commission.  The  permanent
representatives  of  the  Council  meet  frequently
and  decide  by  consensus.  There  are  approxi-
mately  250  committees,  working  groups  and
expert groups that discuss programs and review
progress on issues. The Secretariat is located in
Paris and consists of about 2,500 staff members,
including financial specialists, lawyers, scientists
and  other  professionals.  The  Secretariat  sup-
ports committees and completes tasks based on
priorities set by the OECD Council. The OECD is

CHAPTER 14 • INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND STANDARDS

funded by members countries based on a formula
that  takes  into  account  the  size  of  each  mem-
ber’s economy.

The  OECD  may  develop  standards  and  models,
recommendations  or  guidelines.  OECD  publica-
tions play an important role in disseminating the
OECD’s  programs  and  positions.  Because  of  the
OECD’s diverse focus, the standards it promotes
apply  in  a  number  of  financial  crime  fields.  One
of the most important is the OECD Anti-Bribery
Convention,  which  contains  provisions  seek-
ing  enactment  of  laws  to  criminalize  bribery  of
foreign  public  officials  in  international  business
transactions.  It  also  provides  a  host  of  related
enforcement measures. The Convention on Com-
bating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in Inter-
national Business Transactions and Related Doc-
uments is discussed in the Global Anti-Corruption
chapter, and a link is included in the appendix.

The OECD has also been active in building inter-
national  cooperation  on  tax  evasion  and  tax
avoidance.  In  addition  to  helping  create  formal
tax  treaties,  the  OECD  member  countries  have
used  the  organization  as  a  forum  for  increased
cooperation for the exchange of tax information
among countries. In April 2013, the OECD called
for member states to implement a system of auto-
matic exchange of financial account information
for  tax  purposes,  similar  to  the  model  estab-
lished  by  the  US  Foreign  Account  Tax  Compli-
ance Act. This later became the Common Report-
ing Standard.

To help execute the provisions of its conventions,
the OECD organizes Working Groups, composed
of  experts  from  member  nations.  The  Working
Groups collect information from OECD members
on how they are implementing the policies of the
conventions and issues reports on the progress of
member states, similar to the FATF mutual evalu-
ation process. The Working Group on Bribery, for
example,  oversees  implementation  of  the  OECD
Anti-Bribery Convention.

The  Working  Groups,  as  well  as  other  OECD
groups  such  as  the  CleanBizGov  Initiative,  pro-
mote greater public and private sector transpar-
ency, issue reports and publications that are use-
ful for financial crime specialists. All are available
on the OECD website at http://www.oecd.org.

BASEL COMMITTEE AND
ITS GUIDANCE
The  Basel  Committee  is  an  international  body
consisting  of  senior  representatives  of  central
banks and government banking regulatory agen-
cies.  Originally  intended  as  a  forum  to  discuss
bank supervision issues when it was established
by the Group of 10 countries in 1974, it has evolved
into  a  body  that  sets  international  standards  on
banking  supervision  generally,  including  stand-
ards on financial crime compliance.

One  of  the  most  important  documents  of  the
Basel Committee is the Basel III Accords, a com-
prehensive set of measures designed to reinforce
the regulation, supervision and risk management
of the banking sector. Although it is an important
document for the financial sector, its recommen-
dations do not directly touch financial crime and
is not addressed in detail here.

CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE FOR BANKS
The Basel Committee publication, Customer Due
Diligence for Banks, is another significant guide-
line,  particularly  for  compliance  officers.  It  pro-
vides  guidance  on  the  elements  and  implemen-
tation  of  customer  due  diligence  programs  for
banks and explains key elements of a “know your
customer”  policy,  including  policies  for  accept-
ing  customers,  identifying  customers,  ongoing
monitoring  of  accounts  and  transactions  and
risk  management.  It  also  discusses  the  key  role
of supervisors and managers in the KYC process
and best practices for implementing KYC across
national borders.

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

281

CHAPTER 14 • INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND STANDARDS

The  Customer  Due  Diligence  standards  range
from the general, such as recommending that due
diligence is proportionate to the customer risk, to
the  much  more  specific.  For  example,  the  stand-
ards recommend that a customer’s first payment
through an account in the customer’s name with
another  institution  should  be  subject  to  similar
customer due diligence standards.

In many respects, Directives mirror the FATF Rec-
ommendations.  EU  member  states  are  allowed
to independently enact more stringent AML and
financial  crime  policies  than  those  specified  in
the  Directives.  As  of  early  2018,  EU  authorities
had  implemented  the  4th  AML  Directive,  which
aligned the EU’s AML regime with the revised 40
Recommendations of the FATF released in 2012.

In  addition  to  financial  institutions,  the  commit-
tee says customer due diligence principles should
be  developed  for  non-bank  financial  institutions
and  mediators  of  financial  services,  such  as
accountants and lawyers.

The EU’s governing bodies also agreed to a pack-
age  of  amendments  and  enhancements,  known
as  the  5th  Directive,  that  expanded  corpo-
rate  transparency  through  publicly  accessible
national registries.

CONSOLIDATED KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER
(KYC) RISK MANAGEMENT
The  Committee  published  the  Consolidated
KYC  Risk  Management  in  October  2004,  which
includes  guidelines  for  policies  and  procedures
governing  “know  your  customer”  operations
at  banks.  In  a  brief  nine  pages,  it  provides  a
good  high-level  overview  of  KYC  processes  and
best practices.

It also covers management and oversight of KYC
programs,  policies  for  customer  identification
and acceptance, and recommendations for trans-
action  and  account  monitoring.  In  addition,  it
addresses  how  institutions  should  have  a  global
process for KYC, shared among all branches and
businesses  lines,  as  well  as  information-sharing
across the entire business subject to privacy laws.

EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVES ON
MONEY LAUNDERING
European Union Directives on Money Laundering
are the key AML policy for EU member countries.
Directives specify the legal and regulatory frame-
work that EU nations are required to implement
concerning  money  laundering  controls.  Direc-
tives imposes major compliance requirements on
banks,  other  financial  institutions  and  gatekeep-
ers that operate in or do business in EU nations.

The Directives apply not only to the financial sec-
tor but also to lawyers and accountants, casinos,
estate agents, trust and company service provid-
ers and high value dealers. All persons subject to
the  Directive  must  be  supervised  for  AML  con-
trols by a competent authority.

These  are  some  of  the  other  highlights  of
the Directives:

•  Cover terrorist financing as well as

money laundering.

•  Contain detailed customer due diligence
standards. In particular, it states that:

 » CDD is defined as including not just

customer identification and verification,
but also establishment of the purpose and
intended nature of the business relationship
and ongoing monitoring

 » CDD applies to new and existing customers

 » It requires identification of beneficial

owners and verification of the beneficial
owner’s identity.

 » It contains guidelines for simplified
due diligence for certain low risk
situations, and requires enhanced due
diligence in situations that present a
higher money laundering or terrorist
financing risk – including non-face-to-
face business, ‘politically exposed persons’

and international correspondent banking
relationships.

tax advisors or auditors to comply with
AML regulations

•  Recognize and reinforce the concept of
a risk-based approach to anti-money
laundering. Under the 4th Directive, the
EU Commission and European supervisory
authorities (ESAs) will conduct assessments
of financial crime risks and make them
available to member states.

•  Implement a system of corporate registries

to capture the beneficial ownership
information of companies and other entities.
Each EU state is required to create or
enhance a corporate registry that includes
the beneficial owners of companies and
trusts. Beneficial owners of corporations will
be publicly available, while owners of trusts
will be available to government authorities,
financial institutions and civil society groups.
Apply a licensing-registration system for
‘currency exchange offices’ as well as trust
and company formation and other service
providers that involve a “fit and proper test”
for those who direct or beneficially own
these businesses.

•  As of the 5th Directive, include digital

currency administrators and exchanges
under institutions that are subject to AML
regulations and reporting

•  As of the 5th Directive, reduce the thresholds
on anonymous pre-paid card transactions
so that they can only be used for small
transactions

•  Require the EU Commission to issue a list of

jurisdictions with AML deficiencies, including
jurisdictions with weak frameworks on
beneficial ownership
Require financial firms to apply customer
due diligence and record-keeping standards
to overseas branches and majority-owned
subsidiaries (unless it is not permitted
by local law)

•  Requires art dealers and professionals who
provide “similar services” to accountants,

WOLFSBERG GROUP
The  Wolfsberg  Group  is  a  private-sector  associ-
ation of eleven global financial institutions. It is a
standard-setting organization that issues recom-
mended  policies  and  procedures  for  Know  Your
Customer,  AML  and  terrorist  financing  in  the
financial services sector.

The Group consists of Banco Santander, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit
Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, J.P.
Morgan Chase, Société Générale and UBS. It was
formed in 2000.

The  Group  publishes  numerous  documents
called  the  Wolfsberg  Standards  that  deal  with
various  aspects  of  banking.  The  Wolfsberg  Stan-
dards  cover  a  wide  array  of  topics  from  general
subjects,  such  as  AML  and  terrorist  financing,
to  more  industry-specific  guidance  on  prepaid
cards,  trade  finance  and  correspondent  bank-
ing. They are a valuable resource for compliance
professionals. The Wolfsberg Standards are avail-
able  at  http://www.wolfsberg-  principles.com/
standards.html.

The Wolfsberg Anti-Money Laundering Principles
for  Private  Banking,  along  with  its  accompany-
ing  documents  on  intermediaries  and  beneficial
ownership,  are  key  guidance  for  financial  insti-
tutions.  The  Principles  were  released  in  Octo-
ber 2000 and revised in May 2002 and May 2012
(see Appendix).

Principles for Private Banking takes into account
certain recognized risks associated with private
banking  to  prevent  the  use  of  a  bank’s  interna-
tional  operations  for  criminal  purposes  and  to
protect  the  organization’s  reputation.  The  Prin-
ciples lay out guidance on customer identity and
verification  of  beneficial  ownership,  as  well  as
how to treat customers that arrive through inter-

283

@2019 Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists

CHAPTER 14 • INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND STANDARDS

mediaries. For example, the Principles state that
in  certain  circumstances  banks  may  rely  on  the
intermediary  to  collect  information  and  docu-
ments required for customer due diligence.

The Principles cover situations that may warrant
enhanced  due  diligence,  including  customers
located in high-risk jurisdictions and PEPs. They
also  provide  direction  on  recommended  actions
to take when unusual or suspicious activities are
detected,  as  well  as  ongoing  customer  monitor-
ing and screening.

In  addition  to  its  Statements  and  Principles,  the
Wolfsberg  Group  also  created  the  “International
Due Diligence Repository,” a database of due dil-
igence information and documentation on finan-
cial institutions.

According  to  the  Wolfsberg  Group,  the  Reposi-
tory includes information on each financial insti-
tution’s  license  (and  the  licenses  of  their  sub-
sidiaries)  and  copies  of  corporate  governance
documents, such as company by-laws, Articles or
Certificate  of  Incorporation,  and  Memorandum,
Articles or Certificate of Association.

Other information that can be obtained from the
Repository  includes  biographies  of  board  mem-
bers and  senior  management  of a  financial  insti-
tution,  annual  reports  and  standard  AML  ques-

tionnaire  forms  from  financial  institutions.  The
Repository  can  be  a  valuable  resource  for  other
institutions  conducting  due  diligence,  as  well  as
investigators and regulators attempting to assess
a bank’s governance and AML program.

CONCLUSION
While  they  may  sometimes  seem  remote  from  a
professional’s  day-to-day  duties,  international
standards  and  agreements,  as  well  as  the  orga-
nizations that develop them, are an essential ele-
ment of the financial crime field. Many standards
contain  guidance  on  compliance  and  enforce-
ment best practices that can be applied at finan-
cial  institutions  and  government  agencies.  Oth-
ers  raise  awareness  of  key  policy  or  regulatory
weaknesses  that  are  not  being  addressed  in  the
public and private sectors.

Whatever  their  source  and  purpose,  these  stan-
dards serve as a reminder of the vast and complex
spectrum  of  financial  crime.  Preventing  finan-
cial crime is a global battle fought on many levels,
which extends from the smallest transaction at a
local bank to the halls of the United Nations.

ANSWERS TO
PRACTICE QUESTIONS

CHAPTER 3 – MONEY LAUNDERING:
Q 3-1. Chuck Smith conducted a Ponzi scheme by luring innocent domestic investors to invest. He claimed
they  would  get  a  steady  stream  of  payments  over  time  and  would  receive  a  handsome  return  on  their
investments. The transaction worked as follows:

•  All investors reside in Smith’s country and wired money to Smith in order to make an investment in reliance on

his representations, which later turned out to be false.

•  Smith next moved the funds to an offshore bank account.

•  Smith then transferred some of the funds from new investors to previous investors claiming it was money

generated by their investment.

•  Smith used the remaining funds to purchase cars and other luxury gifts to create the appearance that he

was successful.

The underlying criminal activity in this case was wire fraud. At which point did money laundering FIRST take place?
−  A. When the investor wired money to Smith in reliance on his false representations
−  B. When Smith transferred some of the funds from new investors to previous investors claiming it was
money generated by their investment
−  C. When Smith used the remaining funds to purchase cars and other luxury gifts to create the appear-
ance that he was successful
"  D. When Smith wired funds to the offshore bank account

Answer A is incorrect because the investors’ funds could not be considered proceeds of illegal activity until
they were in the possession of the Ponzi schemer. The transaction was therefore not an act of money laun-
dering, although it could be considered a “specified unlawful activity.”

Answer B is incorrect because the question asks for the first instance money laundering took place. Although
this could be considered money laundering, it is not the first occurrence.

Answer C is incorrect for the same reason as Answer B.

Answer D is correct because this is the first instance where Smith had obtained the proceeds of a criminal
activity and was conducting a transaction with them. It is the most appropriate first instance of money laun-
dering in this scenario.

Q 3-2. A compliance officer at a major insurance company has recently noticed a pattern of potentially
suspicious  transactions  from  a  long-time  customer.  The  customer  is  employed  in  a  consulting  position
that  requires  her  to  travel  internationally  on  an  unpredictable  schedule  and  she  often  resides  overseas
for extended periods. The customer has several properties insured with the company for large amounts.
In the past three years, she has overpaid her premiums numerous times and then requested a refund be
issued. Concerned that the customer may be laundering funds through the overpayment of premiums, the
officer is investigating the transactions.

Which fact would BEST indicate money laundering may be taking place?

−  A. The customer often requests that refunds be made by wire transfer to banks outside of the country.

−  B. The customer makes the overpayments at different times of the year and in varying amounts.

−  C.  The  customer  has  recently  taken  out  a  sizeable  new  insurance  policy  on  a  commercial  property  with
your company.

"  D. The customer has requested that refunds on excess premiums be made to an attorney.Q 3-3. A financial insti-
tution holds an account for a charitable organization whose stated mission is to promote literacy in the local com-
munity. The charity derives most of its financial backing from periodic fundraising drives that take in hundreds of
small donations from individual donors.

Answer A is incorrect because it cannot be considered unusual activity due to her customer profile. In the
scenario, we state “The customer is employed in a consulting position that requires her to travel internatio-
nally on an unpredictable schedule and she often resides overseas for extended periods.” As such, requesting
wire transfers to banks outside her country would not be out of the ordinary for this customer.

Answer B is incorrect because the nature of the overpayments actually matches the customer profile. The
fact that she travels on an “unpredictable schedule” supports the fact that the activity is happening at dif-
ferent times of the year. Also, the fact that she “has several properties insured with the company for large
amounts” contributes to the fact that the overpayments are in different amounts.

Answer C is incorrect because it is largely irrelevant to the scenario, and the fact that she already has several
large policies with the company makes it consistent with her profile.

Answer D is correct because it incorporates a classic red flag of money laundering, in that the refunds of the
overpayment of premiums are being sent to a third party.

Q  3-3.  A  financial  institution  holds  an  account  for  a  charitable  organization  whose  stated  mission  is  to
promote literacy in the local community. The charity derives most of its financial backing from periodic
fundraising drives that take in hundreds of small donations from individual donors.

Recently,  the  institution  conducted  a  due  diligence  investigation  and  noticed  anomalous  activity  in  the  cha-
rity’s account.

Which of these is a red flag for potential terrorist financing?

−  A. The charity recently purchased a large insurance policy which does not have a surrender clause and cannot be
used as collateral.

−  B. The charity has no long-term leasing agreement on a physical property in a nearby town.

"  C. The transaction history indicates a pattern of wire transfers to countries with no previous connection to the
charity’s activities.

−  D. The transaction history for the charity shows a large number of small cash deposits.

Answer  A  is  incorrect.  It  would  not  be  uncommon  for  an  insurance  policy  to  lack  a  surrender  clause  and
collateral.  Those  features  actually  increase  the  risk  that  an  insurance  policy  could  be  used  in  a  financial
crime scheme.

Answer  B  is  incorrect.  A  lack  of  long-term  lease  is  not  generally  indicative  of  terrorist  financing  or  other
financial crime, is not the best choice of the options given here.

Answer C is correct. Wire transfers to other countries outside of an entity’s operation are an indicator of
potential terrorist financing, especially in the case of non-profits and charities.

Answer D is incorrect. As the scenario states, the charity obtains its funding from drives that take in hun-
dreds of small donations. This would be consistent with the deposit activity indicated here.

Q 3-4. You are the chief anti-money laundering officer of a full-service bank, and you are designing a risk-
based customer acceptance program to determine the Terrorist Financing risks specific to not-for-profit
(NFP) organizations.

Which enhanced due diligence activity is most essential for these types of client relationships due to the elevated
risk that NFPs pose?

− A. Monitor the financial activity in relation to the stated purpose and objectives of the entity.

− B. Obtain a copy of the organization’s charter

" C. Establish who controls the organization and its financial activities down to a low threshold

− D. For NFPs, customer acceptance requirements are the same as for any other customer

Answer A is incorrect. Conducting monitoring of transactions based on the expected activity and purpose of
account is a minimum requirement for any customer, and would not be considered enhanced due diligence
in response to higher risk.

Answer B is incorrect. Obtaining a charter or other formation documents would be a typical part of the cus-
tomer onboarding process, and would not generally be considered enhanced due diligence.

Answer  C  is  correct.  Capturing  ownership  of  NFPs,  and  going  beyond  the  typical  threshold  to  gain  more
thorough understanding of the control structure and risks posed by an entity, is a key step for enhanced
due diligence

Answer D is incorrect. According to best practices from the FATF and others, NFPs should generally be con-
sidered as elevated above the standard risk, and require additional measures for customer due diligence.

CHAPTER 4 – UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING FRAUD:
Q  4-1.  The  CFO  of  a  large  public  corporation  sees  that  the  company’s  quarterly  numbers  are  going  to
exceed analysts’ expectations. Knowing the stock price will probably make a big jump when this news is
released, he makes several large open stock repurchases, which increases the intrinsic value of the tens of
thousands of shares he already owns.

He then mentions the earnings report to his wife, and she buys 1,000 shares of stock in her personal trading account.
Her broker, who knows that she is married to the CFO of this company, feels that she must know something, so he
recommends it to many of his clients who buy some very large blocks.

The quarterly numbers are released, and the stock makes a big move as expected. Which individual in this scenario
has committed insider trading?

−  A. The CFO

"  B. The CFO’ wife

−  C. The wife’s stockbroker

−  D. The stockbroker’s clients

Answer A is incorrect due to the fact that while the CFO clearly had insider information, he did not execute
any trades or participate in any actions that personally benefitted him. The large stock repurchases would
likely  indirectly  benefit  him  since  they  reduce  the  liquidity  in  the  marketplace  and  increase  the  intrinsic
value of the remaining outstanding stock, of which he owns a great deal. Therefore, any subsequent good
news  (like  beating  analyst  projections)  would  have  a  greater  positive  impact  on  the  stock  price.  However,
since this action benefits ALL shareholders it cannot be considered insider trading.

Answer B is correct because the wife had insider knowledge and executed a trade that personally benefitted
her. While she did not hold an insider position, she still had the requisite insider knowledge to commit insi-
der trading. Nowhere in the scenario does it say that the husband had knowledge of this action. If he did, he
might be considered in violation of insider trading rules as well. In real life, the CFO might be hard pressed
to prove he had no knowledge of this trade. In this scenario, choosing between answer A and B is clear due
the fact the CFO’s wife actually executed the trade, and there is no mention of the CFO having knowledge.

Answer C is incorrect due to the fact that the stockbroker did not have any insider knowledge. Since corpo-
rate officers are required to report on their trades, following the actions of known insiders is common in the
marketplace and not illegal.

Answer D is not correct because the clients are even further removed from insider knowledge.

CHAPTER 5 – GLOBAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT:
Q  5-1.  You  are  a  compliance  analyst  at  a  multinational  financial  institution  that  provides  banking  and
investment services to large institutional customers. Your institution is currently seeking new business
opportunities  providing  services  to  universities,  hospitals,  and  other  institutions  with  potential  ties  to
political officials and government agencies. Your institution plans to expand into Norway, India, Botswana
and Chile and has asked you to assess the corruption risks of offering its services in each nation.

What is an accurate risk rating for these countries?

−  A. Providing investment and banking services in Norway poses the highest risk for corruption due to a history of
bribery by Norwegian state-owned oil companies.

"  B. Providing services in India poses the highest risk for corruption due to the prevalence of state-owned entities
and Politically-Exposed Persons (PEPs).

−   C. Providing investment and banking services in Botswana poses the highest risk for corruption due to wide-
spread graft in government contracts.

−  D. Providing services in Chile poses the highest risk due to connections between the Chilean government and
international organized crime rings.

Answer  A  is  incorrect,  as  while  there  have  been  some  FCPA  cases  involving  Norwegian  state-  owned  oil
companies, Norway is still considered to be a highly transparent and compliant jurisdiction by international
organizations. This question relies on some knowledge of commonly-used standards and resources used to
rate corruption and financial crime risks internationally, such as the Transparency International Corruption
Perceptions Index, Basel Committee AML Index, and FATF lists of high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions.

Answer B is correct as state-owned entities and public-private partnerships are very prevalent in India, and
the country has a history of corruption among public officials. India is generally considered a higher risk for
corruption than the other nations listed here.

Answer  C  is  incorrect,  as  while  Africa  is  generally  considered  to  be  high-risk  for  corruption,  Botswana  is
widely recognized as a clean nation that has taken considerable efforts in recent years to combat corruption
and ensure transparent governance.

Answer D is incorrect and simply intended to distract the test-taker. While organized crime groups oper-
ate  in  Chile  like  any  other  country,  there  is  little  to  suggest  they  have  close  ties  to  government  agencies
within Chile

Q 5-2. A pharmaceutical sales representative from Company X visits a hospital in the country of Rachman-
istan in order to discuss the benefit of his company’s latest drug. The hospital’s chief of internal medicine,
Dr. Y, agrees to meet with him to learn more about the drug and suggests meeting over dinner at a local
bistro. The week after the dinner takes place, the sales rep sends Dr. Y a gift basket as a token of gratitude
for taking the time to speak with him. Company X is publicly traded in the United States and the healthcare
industry in Rachmanistan is entirely government-owned.

Which statement is NOT true?

−  A. Paying for Dr. Y’s dinner is permissible under the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

"  B. Dr. Y is a medical professional and thus exempt from the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

−  C. Dr. Y can be considered a foreign public official under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act because
he is a high-level employee at a government-owned entity.

−  D. Sending Dr. Y a gift basket is permissible under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Answer A is incorrect because taking someone to dinner, as long as it is not excessively extravagant, is per-
missible. This is reinforced by the section of the scenario that says that they “had dinner at a local bistro,”
rather than a fancy restaurant.

Answer B is correct because Dr. Y is not exempt due to the fact that he is a medical professional. Medical
professionals can still be considered public officials under the FCPA, and there are no exemptions for product
type or profession.

Answer C is incorrect because he can, in fact, be considered a public official because he is a high-ranking
employee of a state-owned enterprise. The definition of public official is intentionally broad in this law to
prevent state owned business employees from leveraging their position to affect bribes.

Answer D is incorrect because sending a gift basket can be considered a ‘token gift’ under the FCPA. Token
gifts are an intentionally vague definition, but a simple gift basket would qualify. There is no indication that
there were any high value items, such as champagne or caviar, as a component of this gift basket.

CHAPTER 6 – TAX EVASION AND ENFORCEMENT:
Q 6-1. Your bank holds a business account for a local tax preparation service.

What would MOST likely trigger further investigation by the compliance department in the bank?

"  A. Numerous deposits of tax refund checks in the names of different individuals but with common addresses

−  B. Multiple deposits of checks in the same amount written by different tax service customers

−  C. Variances in the frequency of transactions depending on the calendar cycle

−  D. A request by the customer to have payments made to the Tax Office through a certified check process

Answer A is the correct answer due to the fact that this is a classic red flag for tax fraud. Multiple tax refund
checks  for  different  individuals  going  to  the  same  address  should  set  off  warning  alarms  in  nearly  every
jurisdiction.

Answer B is incorrect because this perfectly fits the customer’s profile. The deposit of checks from different
tax service customers is what you would expect as each customer paid their bill for the service. You would
also expect many of them to be in the same amount for a typical tax preparation service since the fee for tax
preparation would be the same for many customers.

Answer C is incorrect because, once again, this fits the customer profile. You would expect variances depend-
ing on the calendar cycle as this is largely a seasonal business based on tax reporting deadlines.

Answer D is incorrect because there is no indication of tax fraud in this response. The customer is making
payments to his jurisdiction’s tax authorities using a certified check, which is simply a check for which a bank
has confirmed sufficient funds exist to cover the amount of the check. This is not a viable means to commit
tax fraud, and would more likely indicate no fraud is taking place.

news reports.

Which statement is true about this bank?

−  A. The bank must register and report US accountholders directly with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

−  B. The bank must institute a 30% withholding on the accounts of its US customers

−  C. The bank must confirm that U.S. customers filed a Form 8938 with the IRS to disclose their accounts

"  D. The bank is required to report certain details about US accountholders to its country’s tax authorities

Answer A is incorrect. As the scenario states, the bank is located in a country with a Model 1 agreement in
place to implement FATCA. Under the terms of a Model 1 agreement, institutions do not have to report infor-
mation directly to the IRS, they report to their country’s own tax authorities instead.

Answer B is incorrect. FATCA does not require institutions to impose the 30% withholding on US accoun-
tholders by default. The withholding is a penalty intended for accounts or institutions who refuse to coop-
erate with FATCA requirements.

Answer C is incorrect. US persons with accounts in other countries are required to file Form 8938 with the
IRS, but this is an obligation of the taxpayer. Financial institutions are not required to ensure that taxpayers
have filed the required form.

Answer D is correct. Under FATCA and a Model 1 agreement, a bank would be required to report information
on US persons to its own tax authorities, who are then responsible for transmitting it to the IRS.

CHAPTER 7 – ASSET RECOVERY:
Q 7-1. In a Venezuela court case for fraud against individuals and companies around the world, documents
have been obtained that would be helpful in a related proceeding in Miami in the United States. Venezu-
ela and the US are parties to the Hague Evidence Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or
Commercial Matters. No special laws exist in either jurisdiction for the evidence sought.

To  ensure  these  documents  are  properly  received  in  evidence  in  the  US,  which  two  are  acceptable  methods  of
requesting such evidence?

"  A. Letters Rogatory through the authority designed by Venezuela or other authority allowed by such law

−  B. Transmission of the discovery request to the target of discovery

"  C. Transmission through a private party, such as an attorney, in Venezuela, if private law so provides

−    D.  Issuance  of  subpoena  duces  tecum  and  scheduling  of  place  and  time  for  the  party  to  make  itself  available
for examination

Answer A is correct because Letters Rogatory are a viable means to request information in a legal matter
across borders in a way that maximizes the likelihood that it can be used as evidence. From the study man-
ual: “A Letter Rogatory is a request from one judge to another judge in another country seeking assistance in
obtaining information, documents or testimony in a particular legal matter.”

Answer B is incorrect because directly asking the target of the discovery request for the documents holds
no  legal  weight.  It  is  extremely  unlikely  that  this  will  be  successful  in  an  adversarial  case,  particularly  in
a fraud case.

Answer  C  is  correct  because  this  is  a  viable  method  of  requesting  cross  border  documents  under  The
Hague Convention.

Answer D is incorrect because a subpoena duces tecum is not an internationally used legal order. Even if it
was, making a party available for examination does nothing to advance the effort of getting the documents
produced, which is the focus in this scenario.

CHAPTER 10 – MONEY AND COMMODITIES FLOWS:
Q  10-1.  An  investigation  of  an  export-import  corporation  in  Florida  that  exports  large  household  appli-
ances to Colombia discloses the following:

1.  The corporation’s sources of funds for the purchase of the items are large check deposits from a small

number of other Florida export companies.

2.  Each of the customer business accounts is funded by small checks from numerous personal accounts
that are domiciled in banks in New York or South Florida. Each deposit is for less than $3,000 and for
an amount in even $100 dollar increments. increments.

What is this money laundering scheme known as?

−  A. Transfer Pricing Scheme

"  B. Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE)

−  C. Bulk Cash Smuggling

−  D. Carousel Fraud

Answer A is incorrect because the fact pattern described bears no resemblance to transfer pricing. Trans-
fer pricing schemes are a method of allocating profits between different branches or subsidiaries of a legal
entity in order to reduce the entity’s overall tax burden.

Answer  B  is  correct  because  the  pattern  of  transactions  is  indicative  of  BMPE.  There  is  unusual  deposit
activity that is indicative of structuring, followed by lump-sum payments to US appliance exporters. Another
indicator is the parties and locations involved. An exporter in the US sending appliances to Colombia is a
classic example of BMPE.

Answer C is incorrect because there is no cross-border movement of large volumes of cash in described in
this scenario, and no other red flags or suspicious activity that would indicate the exporter is involved in bulk
cash smuggling

Answer D is incorrect in part because carousel fraud is a tax fraud scheme, not a money laundering scheme.
It hinges on abusing the value-added tax (VAT) system, which is common in Europe but not present in the US,
where this investigation is taking place.

Q 10-2. A young woman, who is a national of Country A, works as a caregiver for a family in the US. She
sends much of her earnings to support her family back in Country A by giving the amount in cash to a local
grocer, whose family heritage is also in Country A. Once the grocer receives the cash, he calls his partner
who runs a market in one of the larger cities in Country A. From there, the young woman’s family can pick
up the money sent.

What is the name commonly used to describe this form of remittance transaction?

−  A. Cash transfer

" B. Hawala

−  C. Referral Banking

−  D. Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE)

Answer A is incorrect because Cash Transfer is not a real type of funds transmission. It is the colloquial term
used for Money Transmitter Business (MSBs) services; but there is no actual transfer taking place here.

Answer B is correct as this is a classic Hawala transfer.

Answer C is incorrect as this has nothing to do with referral banking. This response is simply a distraction.

Answer  D  is  incorrect  because  the  fact  pattern  described  here  bears  little  relation  to  Black  Market  Peso
Exchange, which typically involves the movement of both currency and goods across borders and the pres-
ence of currency brokers, and is not a trust-based informal value transfer system as described here.

CHAPTER 11 – COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND CONTROLS:
Q 11-1. As the compliance officer in a national financial institution, you have recently received an alert from
your regulator warning of suspected bulk cash smuggling into your jurisdiction.

Which recent activity might be indicative of bulk cash smuggling?

−    A.  An  increase  in  domestic  wire  transfers  between  another  bank  within  your  jurisdiction  and  your  finan-
cial institution

−  B. A significant number of cash withdrawals, all under $10,000, from your financial institution

"  C. Large amounts of small denomination currency being sent from a Foreign Financial Institution (FFI) to their
account at your bank

−  D. A dramatic increase in domestic ACH transactions at your bank

Answer A in incorrect because the alert received was for bulk cash smuggling into your jurisdiction. The fact
that the transfers are all taking place within your jurisdiction eliminates this answer.

Answer B is incorrect as bulk cash smuggling would result in large cash deposits into your institution; not
withdrawals.  The  amounts  being  under  $10,000  is  a  red  herring  because  it  is  close  to  many  jurisdiction’s
reporting threshold.

Answer  C  is  correct  as  this  is  a  classic  red  flag  of  bulk  cash  smuggling.  When  physically  smuggling  large
amounts of cash across a border most criminals would want to reduce the physical bulk of the cash by con-
verting as much as they could into larger denomination bills. This would result in significant amount s of
small denomination currency being sent by foreign banks into your jurisdiction.

Answer D is incorrect as ACH transactions usually have no connection to bulk cash smuggling. Also, these
are  domestic  transactions,  which  would  indicate  they  are  not  connected  to  any  cross-border  cash-smug-
gling operation.

Q 11-2. A US bank receives a letter of credit from an issuing bank in connection with the purchase of wheat
from a bank customer. The buyer/applicant is located in Belarus, a country in which certain senior govern-
ment officials are on the US Specially Designated National (SDN) List. The country is not, however, subject
to comprehensive US sanctions.

The  buyer  is  determined  to  be  a  joint  venture  in  which  a  Belarus  SDN  has  a  50%  interest  through  two  separate
companies wholly owned by the SDN. Each has a 25% interest in the joint venture. No funds have yet been received
by the bank.

Which statement is true about this situation?

−  A. The letter of credit can be processed and the funds paid because the customer is not on the SDN List and the
SDN does not have a majority or controlling interest.

−    B.  The  letter  of  credit  can  be  processed  and  the  funds  paid  because  the  US  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control
(OFAC) has issued general licenses exempting food from US sanctions.

"  C. The letter of credit must be blocked by the US bank and reported to OFAC even though no funds have yet
been received.

−  D. The letter of credit cannot be accepted or acted on so it must be returned to the advising bank with notice that
any funds received will be blocked.

Answer A is incorrect because one of the customers involved in the transaction is in fact an SDN. The buyer
mentioned in the scenario is said to be a joint venture that is 50% owned by two persons on the SDN list.
Under US sanctions regimes, if a person or entity on an SDN list has a 50% or more ownership stake in an
entity or company, that entity or company is subject to the same restrictions as an SDN, including blocking
of transactions.

Answer B is incorrect because US sanctions regimes are country, person or entity-specific. OFAC does not
issue blanket licenses exempting an entire class of good or transaction from sanctions. While under some
sanctions laws food and agricultural goods are exempt from sanctions, in other cases they are not.

Answer C is correct because it accurately describes the steps the bank must take in order to remain com-
pliant with OFAC sanctions laws. The buyer was found to be an SDN, which requires the bank to block the
transaction.

Answer D is incorrect because notifying the parties to a sanctioned transaction that it would be blocked is
explicitly prohibited by US sanctions laws. Funds or financial instruments involved in sanctioned transac-
tions are typically required to be blocked, and are not returned to any of the parties in a transaction.

Q 11-3. A small regional bank has recently started using a new transaction monitoring tool that utilizes
several custom scenarios to identify specific activity which was defined by the Financial Crimes Compli-
ance team. There are five scenarios that are live in production. The Analytics team within Financial Crimes
Compliance has performed some research on the scenarios and is ready to make recommendation to man-
agement regarding possible changes to the scenarios.

Which scenario(s) should the Analytics team recommend making changes to first?

−  A. Scenario A that has generated 100 alerts in the past three months and 50% of those have been deemed suspi-
cious and a suspicious transaction report was filed.

−  B. Scenario B that has generated 180 alerts with a 95% false positive rate.

"  C. Scenario C that has generated no alerts and there appears to be a problem with the mapping of data.

−  D. Scenarios D and E that were put into production in the last 30 days to address a matter requiring attention
from a regulator.

Answer A in incorrect as this appears to be a well performing scenario. It is generating alerts, and the per-
centage of those that were actually deemed suspicious is reasonable.

Answer B is incorrect because while the false positive rate is far too high, it is at least generating alerts and
some are still deemed suspicious. The false positive rate is clearly an issue that will have to be addressed, but
this scenario would not be the one that would need to be addressed first. There will often be scenarios on
the live exam that require you to pick the best answer. In this case, this is not the best answer.

Answer C is correct as this clearly is a broken scenario since not one alert has been generated. The fact that
there appears to be a problem with the mapping of the data only reinforces the conclusion that this scenario
must be addressed first.

Answer D is incorrect as there is no evidence that the scenarios are not performing as expected.

CHAPTER 12 – CYBERSECURITY
Q  12-1.  Your  financial  institution  has  been  subject  to  several  hacking  attempts  over  the  last  few  weeks.
While none have been successful, you worry that it might be a matter of time. To keep your network secure,
you have decided to update your network security policies.

What is an important step to include in your network security policy?

"  A. Educate your online customers to detect phishing attempts and other fraudulent email scams.

−  B. Disable auto deletion of old data, including access logs, and move them to an archive server.

−  C. Only permit administrative connections via the Internet through HTTPS or SSH connections.

−  D. Require confirmation from network engineering before resetting any lost passwords.

Answer A is correct as this is a recommended step in all network security policies. While not high tech or
glamorous, educating your staff and your customers to recognize phishing and fraudulent emails is a funda-
mental and highly successful way to prevent fraud.

Answer B is incorrect as this is the opposite of a good data retention policy, and has nothing to do with a
network security policy.

Answer C is incorrect as a good security policy will not allow any administrative connections through the
internet, even via secure connections like HTTPS or SSH. Administrative connections are those that allow
you to log into internal devices and make changes to how they function. This task should only be allowed
from internal connections.

Answer D is incorrect as it is not very scalable and network engineering is the wrong group to manage this
anyway. There are hundreds of password resets that are performed every day by most large financial insti-
tutions. There is no way that the network engineering staff would be able to keep up with the requests. They
would also have no way to determine if the requests should be approved or denied.

Q 12-2. Your organization has a large online presence, providing all key services online. You have recently
found  out  that  a  hacker  has  gained  access  to  your  secure  network,  stealing  millions  of  customer  user-
names and passwords. You think the access was gained via social engineering.

Your company’s success depends on your keeping this data secure, so your organization wants to put procedures
in place to ensure it can prevent any such further attacks. As an initial step you have terminated internet access for
engineering and IT.

What would be the MOST effective further action for your firm to immediately take to prevent this specific type of
attack from happening again?

"  A. Restrict external access on all routers and servers allowing administrative access only from workstations in
the engineering and IT departments.

−  B. Staff should not be allowed to download any materials from the internet or private disks to the organization’s
local drives.

−    C.  Require  all  customers  to  change  their  passwords  on  a  regular  basis  to  access  their  accounts  and  require
strong passwords.

−  D. Upgrade all network firewalls and ensure they are running current software.

Answer A is correct as this is a viable and recommended security strategy. Not only should administrative
access be restricted to only internal computers (no outside internet connections), it should be restricted to
only those groups that have a viable business purpose for logging into those devices, such as engineering
and IT. If someone manages to acquire information to access the network, via social engineering or other-
wise, there is not much they would be able to do with that information if they had to be sitting at a desk in
your engineering department to actually use it.

Answer B is incorrect. While this is a viable, if extreme, security measure, it does not prevent this specific
type of attack from happening again. Though a common security measure in some very secure government
and private-sector facilities, it does nothing to prevent social engineering attacks. The question specifically
asks for ways to prevent that type of attack.

Answer C is incorrect. While this too is a viable customer security policy, it would not be a component of a
network security policy. It also would do nothing to prevent social engineering attacks.

Answer D is incorrect. Once again, upgrading firewalls and ensuring they are running current software is a
good network security policy, but does not prevent “this specific type of attack from happening again.”

CHAPTER 13 – ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES:
Q  13-1.  Sallie  Jones  holds  a  significant  administrative  position  in  the  Defense  Department  of  her  home
country, overseeing various information technology projects. Sallie’s husband, Joe, was recently hired in
sales  by  a  software  company,  Company  A.  The  CEO  of  Company  A,  a  personal  friend  of  Sallie,  and  ulti-
mately hired Joe.

Shortly after Joe was hired, the Defense Department and Company A entered into a contract for the purchase of
software. Joe was assigned to the account. Sallie was not involved in the initial contract negotiations and did not
know they were taking place. After the contract was signed, Sallie was involved in the decisions to use the company
on subsequent projects.

When did Sallie commit an ethical violation?

−  A.  When  the  CEO  of  Company  A  paid  for  a  dinner  with  Sallie  and  her  husband  during  the  hiring  process
for her husband

−  B. When she continued to maintain a close friendship with the CEO of a vendor of the Defense Department

"    C.  When  she  was  part  of  the  subsequent  decision  process  knowing  that  her  spouse  had  a  financial  interest
in the matter

−  D. When she did not disclose her conflict of interest during the initial contract negotiations

Answer A is incorrect as paying for the dinner in itself is not an ethical violation, and this dinner pre-dates
any other interaction with Company A and the Defense department.

Answer B is incorrect as maintaining a close friendship with someone, regardless of the business relation-
ship, is not an ethical violation. Only if you allow that relationship to influence your decisions does it cross
the line into an ethical issue.

Answer C is correct because there is a clear conflict of interest in this case. Sallie should have recused her-
self from the decision-making process once her family had a financial interest in the selection of the vendor.

Answer D is incorrect because she had no reason to disclose a conflict of interest because she was not part
of the decision-making process to select the vendor.

Q 13-2. The CEO of Company X, a publicly traded corporation, caused Company X to enter into a trans-
action with Company Y in which the CEO is a shareholder. The CEO failed to inform the shareholders of
Company X of his interest in Company Y. However, the transaction will greatly benefit Company X as well
as Company Y.

Which statement is true about this situation?

− A. The CEO has participated in insider trading.

"  B. The CEO has committed self-dealing.

− C. The CEO has been involved with selling away.

− D. The CEO has not committed an ethical violation.

Answer A is incorrect as insider trading involves using insider knowledge to make open market trades to a
person’s personal benefit.

Answer B is correct. A person with a fiduciary responsibility to others (like other shareholders) entering a
transaction with another company in which he has a financial interest is self-dealing. Even though the trans-
action benefited both companies, the CEO would have been required to disclose the relationship beforehand,
which  he  did  not.  There  could  have  been  another,  more  beneficial,  transaction  that  might  have  been  con-
sidered if all of the facts were known. In many jurisdictions, this is not only an ethical violation, but a legal
one as well.

Answer C is incorrect as selling away is when a broker solicits you to purchase securities not held or offered
by the brokerage firm. As a general rule, such activities are a violation of securities regulations, but that did
not occur here.

Answer D is incorrect as there is clearly an ethical violation here. The self-dealing would not have been con-
sidered an ethical violation if he disclosed the relationship first though.
